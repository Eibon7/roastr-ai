description: Use when implementation is complete, all tests pass, and you need to decide how to integrate the work - guides completion of development work by presenting structured options for merge, PR, or cleanup
triggers:
  - "implementation complete"
  - "tests passing"
  - "ready to integrate"
  - "finish feature"
used_by:
  - executing-plans-skill
  - orchestrator
steps:
  - paso1: "Verify tests pass (run test suite)"
  - paso2: "If tests fail: Report failures, stop"
  - paso3: "Determine base branch (main/master)"
  - paso4: "Present exactly 4 options: Merge locally, Push PR, Keep as-is, Discard"
  - paso5: "Execute chosen option"
  - paso6: "Cleanup worktree if applicable (Options 1 & 4)"
output: "Work completed and integrated according to choice"
options:
  merge_locally: |
    1. Switch to base branch
    2. Pull latest
    3. Merge feature branch
    4. Verify tests on merged result
    5. Delete feature branch if tests pass
  push_pr: |
    1. Push branch
    2. Create PR with title and description
    3. Keep worktree (don't cleanup)
  keep_asis: "Keep branch and worktree, don't cleanup"
  discard: |
    1. Confirm with typed 'discard'
    2. Switch to base branch
    3. Delete branch (force)
    4. Cleanup worktree
cleanup_worktree:
  options_cleanup: "1, 4 (merge locally, discard)"
  options_keep: "2, 3 (push PR, keep as-is)"
red_flags:
  - "Skip test verification"
  - "Open-ended questions"
  - "Automatic worktree cleanup"
  - "No confirmation for discard"
key_principle: "Verify tests → Present options → Execute → Cleanup"

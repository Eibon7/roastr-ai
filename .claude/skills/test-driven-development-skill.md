description: Use when implementing any feature or bugfix, before writing implementation code - write the test first, watch it fail, write minimal code to pass; ensures tests actually verify behavior by requiring failure first
triggers:
  - "RED GREEN REFACTOR"
  - "TDD"
  - "write test first"
  - "test failure"
  - "commit sin tests"

steps:
  - paso1: "Iron Law: NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST"
  - paso2: "RED: Write failing test, verify it fails correctly (not errors)"
  - paso3: "GREEN: Write minimal code to pass, verify test passes"
  - paso4: "REFACTOR: Clean up, keep tests green"
  - paso5: "Repeat for next feature"
output: "Tests that actually verify behavior + minimal production code"

  NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
  
  Write code before test? Delete it. Start over.
red_flags:
  - "Code before test"
  - "Test passes immediately"
  - "Tests added later"
  - "Already manually tested"
  - "Delete is wasteful"
when_to_use: "Always - except throwaway prototypes (ask human)"
red_green_refactor:
  red: "Write one minimal test, watch it fail for right reason"
  green: "Minimal code to pass, verify all tests pass"
  refactor: "Clean up only, keep tests green"
rationalizations:
  - "Too simple to test" → "Test takes 30 seconds, simple code breaks"
  - "I'll test after" → "Passing immediately proves nothing"
  - "Already manually tested" → "Ad-hoc ≠ systematic, no record"
  - "Deleting X hours is wasteful" → "Sunk cost fallacy, keeping unverified code is debt"

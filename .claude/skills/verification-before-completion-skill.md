name: verification-before-completion-skill
description: Use when about to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing, before committing or creating PRs - requires running verification commands and confirming output before making any success claims; evidence before assertions always
triggers:
  - "complete"
  - "done"
  - "finished"
  - "passing"
  - "working"
  - "ready"
used_by:
  - all-agents
steps:
  - paso1: "Iron Law: NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE"
  - paso2: "Identify what command proves this claim"
  - paso3: "Run the FULL command (fresh, complete)"
  - paso4: "Read full output, check exit code, count failures"
  - paso5: "Verify: Does output confirm the claim?"
  - paso6: "Only then: Make the claim"
output: "Evidence-based completion claims with verification"
iron_law: |
  NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
  
  Skip any step = lying, not verifying
gate_function:
  - "1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?"
  - "2. RUN: Execute FULL command (fresh, complete)"
  - "3. READ: Full output, check exit code"
  - "4. VERIFY: Does output confirm claim?"
  - "5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim"
red_flags:
  - "Should work now"
  - "Probably"
  - "Seems to"
  - "Looks correct"
  - "Expressing satisfaction before verification"
patterns:
  tests: "[Run npm test] [See: 34/34 pass] 'All tests pass' (NOT 'should pass')"
  build: "[Run build] [See: exit 0] 'Build passes' (NOT 'linter passed')"
  requirements: "Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps"
  agent_delegation: "Agent reports → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state"
rationalizations:
  - "Should work" → "RUN the verification"
  - "I'm confident" → "Confidence ≠ evidence"
  - "Just this once" → "No exceptions"
  - "I'm tired" → "Exhaustion ≠ excuse"

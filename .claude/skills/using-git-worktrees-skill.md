description: Use when starting feature work that needs isolation from current workspace or before executing implementation plans - creates isolated git worktrees with smart directory selection and safety verification
triggers:
  - "isolated workspace"
  - "worktree"
  - "feature isolation"
  - "new feature branch"
used_by:
  - orchestrator
  - writing-plans-skill
  - executing-plans-skill
steps:
  - paso1: "Check existing directories (.worktrees or worktrees)"
  - paso2: "Check CLAUDE.md for preference"
  - paso3: "Ask user if no directory found"
  - paso4: "Safety verification: Check .gitignore before creating worktree"
  - paso5: "Add to .gitignore if missing, commit change"
  - paso6: "Create worktree with new branch"
  - paso7: "Run project setup (npm install, cargo build, etc)"
  - paso8: "Verify clean baseline with tests"
  - paso9: "Report location and ready status"
output: "Isolated worktree at <full-path> with tests passing"
directory_selection:
  priority1: ".worktrees (preferred, hidden)"
  priority2: "worktrees (alternative)"
  priority3: "~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/<project>/ (global)"
safety_verification:
  - "MUST verify .gitignore before creating project-local worktree"
  - "Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents"
  - "If NOT in .gitignore: Add line + commit immediately"
creation_steps:
  - "Detect project name"
  - "Create worktree: git worktree add <path> -b <branch>"
  - "Run project setup (auto-detect package.json, Cargo.toml, etc)"
  - "Verify clean baseline: npm test / cargo test / etc"
  - "Report: Worktree ready at <full-path>, tests passing"
common_mistakes:
  - "Skipping .gitignore verification → worktree contents tracked"
  - "Assuming directory location → violates conventions"
  - "Proceeding with failing tests → can't distinguish new from existing bugs"
red_flags:
  - "Create worktree without .gitignore verification"
  - "Skip baseline test verification"
  - "Assume directory location"

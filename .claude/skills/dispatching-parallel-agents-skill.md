description: Use when facing 3+ independent failures that can be investigated without shared state or dependencies - dispatches multiple Claude agents to investigate and fix independent problems concurrently
triggers:
  - "multiple failures"
  - "independent problems"
  - "parallel investigation"
  - "3+ test failures"
used_by:
  - test-engineer
  - orchestrator
steps:
  - paso1: "Verify: 3+ failures, independent domains, no shared state"
  - paso2: "Identify independent domains by what's broken"
  - paso3: "Create focused agent tasks: Specific scope, clear goal, constraints"
  - paso4: "Dispatch agents in parallel"
  - paso5: "Review summaries, verify fixes don't conflict"
  - paso6: "Run full test suite, integrate changes"
output: |
  - Independent problems fixed in parallel
  - Summary from each agent
  - Full suite passing
  - No conflicts between fixes
when_to_use: "3+ test files failing with different root causes"
when_not_to_use: "Failures related, need full context, shared state"
pattern:
  - "Group by what's broken (File A: tool approval, File B: batch completion)"
  - "Each domain independent - fixing one doesn't affect others"
  - "Dispatch concurrently, review when all return"
agent_prompts:
  - "Focused: One clear problem domain"
  - "Self-contained: All context needed"
  - "Specific output: What should agent return?"
common_mistakes:
  - "Too broad: 'Fix all tests' → agent lost"
  - "No context: 'Fix race condition' → agent doesn't know where"
  - "No constraints: Agent refactors everything"
  - "Vague output: 'Fix it' → don't know what changed"

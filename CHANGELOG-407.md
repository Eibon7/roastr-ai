# 🔬 Triage Decision Matrix Integration Tests - Issue #407

## 📋 PR Summary
**Pull Request**: #441  
**Issue**: [#407 - [Integración] Triage – decisiones block/roast/publish](https://github.com/Eibon7/roastr-ai/issues/407)  
**Implementation Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **Documentation Complete** - Implementation Ready

---

## 🎯 Objectives Achieved

### ✅ Primary Goal
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added complete Triage Decision Matrix specification to `spec.md`
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Detailed technical specification for deterministic block/roast/publish decisions
- **Testing Strategy**: Designed 25-test comprehensive integration test suite
- **Business Logic**: Plan-specific toxicity thresholds and Shield integration patterns

### ✅ Key Documentation Added

#### 🧠 Triage Decision Matrix Logic
- **Plan-Specific Thresholds**:
  - Free Plan: 0.3 roast threshold, Shield disabled
  - Starter Plan: 0.3 roast threshold, Shield enabled
  - Pro Plan: 0.25 roast threshold, Shield enabled  
  - Plus Plan: 0.2 roast threshold, Shield enabled
  - All Plans: 0.7 block threshold

#### 🛡️ Shield System Integration
- **Free Plans**: No Shield integration (cost optimization)
- **Paid Plans**: Full Shield integration with escalating actions:
  - 0.9+ toxicity: `block_and_report` (Priority 1)
  - 0.7+ toxicity: `block` (Priority 2)
  - 0.5+ toxicity: `flag_for_review` (Priority 3)
  - <0.5 toxicity: `allow` (Priority 5)

#### 🔒 Security & Rate Limiting Patterns
- **Fail-Closed Design**: Database failures → deny auto-approval
- **Graceful Degradation**: Rate limit check failures → allow by default
- **Fallback Systems**: Perspective API failure → OpenAI moderation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete correlation ID tracking

## 🎯 Business Impact

### 💰 Revenue Protection
- **Plan Differentiation**: Each tier has distinct toxicity thresholds
- **Feature Gating**: Shield integration limited to paid plans
- **Usage Limits**: Proper rate limiting enforcement

### 🛡️ User Safety
- **Consistent Blocking**: High toxicity content (≥0.7) always blocked
- **Moderation Efficiency**: Automated decision making
- **Compliance**: Complete audit trail for content decisions

### ⚡ System Reliability
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Same input always produces same output
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for high-volume processing
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive fallback systems

---

## 📈 Quality Assurance

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria Addressed
- ✅ **Deterministic Decisions**: Logic designed for consistent behavior
- ✅ **Plan-Specific Behavior**: Threshold differences clearly specified
- ✅ **Shield Integration**: Escalation behavior fully documented
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Enforcement patterns with fail-closed design
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback system designed
- ✅ **Audit Logging**: Complete traceability specification

### 📋 Testing Strategy
- **Integration Testing**: 25 tests covering all decision paths
- **Boundary Testing**: Exact threshold validation
- **Error Scenarios**: Fallback behavior verification
- **Multi-Language**: Unicode and internationalization support
- **Performance**: Deterministic behavior under load

---

## Incident Summary

**What Happened:**
During manual testing documentation, Supabase API credentials (ANON_KEY and SERVICE_KEY) were inadvertently exposed in commit messages and documentation files.

- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9... (EXPOSED)

**Exposure Duration:** ~20 minutes (2025-10-20 17:10 - 17:30 CET)

## Remediation Actions Taken

### ‚úÖ Immediate Actions (Completed)

1. **Commits Removed from Git History**
   ```bash
   # feat/complete-login-registration-593
   git reset --hard b8008dfc
   git push --force origin feat/complete-login-registration-593

   # docs/sync-pr-587
   git reset --hard 6409df31
   git push --force origin docs/sync-pr-587
   ```

2. **Verification**
   ```bash
   # Confirm no keys in current commits
   git log --all --oneline | grep "00361cb5\|20d70966"
   # (no results - commits successfully removed)
   ```

3. **File Cleanup**
   - Removed: `docs/test-evidence/manual-testing-CORRECTED-ANALYSIS.md`
   - Verified no keys in remaining test evidence files

---

## Required Actions (URGENT)

### üö® Priority 1: Rotate Supabase Credentials

**Steps:**

1. **Login to Supabase Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/rpkhiemljhncddmhrilk
   ```

2. **Generate New API Keys:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API
   - Click "Reset anon key" ‚Üí Confirm
   - Click "Reset service_role key" ‚Üí Confirm
   - Copy new keys immediately

3. **Update `.env` File:**
   ```bash
   # IMPORTANT: Update these immediately
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<new_anon_key>
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=<new_service_role_key>
   ```

4. **Restart All Services:**
   ```bash
   # Stop current server
   pkill -f "node.*index.js"

   # Restart with new credentials
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Verify New Keys Work:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Test123!"}'
   ```

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Impact

**ANON_KEY (Public Key):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Risk** - Intended to be public-facing
- Can access public data and perform public operations
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies should protect data
- Still recommended to rotate for security hygiene

**SERVICE_KEY (Admin Key):**
- üö® **CRITICAL RISK** - Should NEVER be exposed
- Bypasses all RLS policies
- Full database access (read, write, delete)
- Can access all user data across all tenants
- Can perform admin operations

### Worst Case Scenarios

1. **Data Breach:**
   - Unauthorized access to all user data
   - Access to all organizations' data
   - Exposure of sensitive PII

2. **Data Manipulation:**
   - Modification of user records
   - Deletion of data
   - Creation of fraudulent accounts

3. **Service Disruption:**
   - Database schema modifications
   - Mass data deletion
   - DoS through API abuse

### Mitigating Factors

‚úÖ **Positive:**
- Exposure was brief (~20 minutes)
- Detected and remediated immediately
- Development environment (not production)
- Limited public visibility (private repo)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Concerning:**
- GitHub makes commits public via API even after removal
- Commits may be cached by GitHub/web crawlers
- Service key has admin privileges

---

## Prevention Measures (Future)

### 1. Never Include Credentials in Code/Docs

**‚ùå Never:**
```markdown
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOi...
```

**‚úÖ Always:**
```markdown
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_anon_key>
# Or
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="Found in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API"
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks

Add to `.husky/pre-commit`:
```bash
# Check for exposed secrets
if grep -r "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9" docs/ README.md; then
  echo "üö® ERROR: Supabase JWT token detected in commit!"
  echo "This looks like an exposed credential. Aborting commit."
  exit 1
fi
```

### 3. Secret Scanning

Enable GitHub secret scanning:
- Settings ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Code security and analysis
- Enable "Secret scanning"
- Enable "Push protection"

### 4. Documentation Standards

Update `docs/QUALITY-STANDARDS.md`:
```markdown
## Security Standards

### Credentials in Documentation

‚ùå **NEVER include:**
- API keys, tokens, or passwords
- Even if masked with `...` or truncated
- Even in test evidence or examples

‚úÖ **Always use:**
- Placeholders: `<your_api_key>`
- References: "See .env.example"
- Masking: First 4 chars only
```

### 5. Code Review Checklist

Add to PR template:
```markdown
- [ ] No credentials exposed in code or docs
- [ ] All secrets referenced from .env only
- [ ] Documentation uses placeholders
```

## Monitoring

**Check for Unauthorized Access:**

1. **Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Check Recent Activity logs
   - Review API Usage metrics
   - Check for unexpected database queries

2. **Database Audit:**
   ```sql
   -- Check for suspicious user creations
   SELECT * FROM auth.users
   WHERE created_at > '2025-10-20 17:00:00'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;

   -- Check for data modifications
   SELECT * FROM auth.audit_log_entries
   WHERE created_at > '2025-10-20 17:00:00'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

3. **GitHub:**
   - Check repository access logs
   - Review recent commits and contributors
   - Verify no forks with exposed keys

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Automation Needed:** Manual testing revealed config issue, but also caused security incident. Need better mocking.

2. **Documentation Standards:** Need explicit rules about credential handling in docs.

3. **Review Process:** Self-review should catch exposed credentials before commit.

4. **Tool Usage:** Consider using tools like `git-secrets` or `trufflehog`.

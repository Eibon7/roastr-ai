## Lessons Learned

### 1. Auto-Generated Files Management
**Finding:** CodeRabbit reviewed auto-generated files, causing confusion.
**Solution:** Created `.gitattributes` to mark auto-generated files with `linguist-generated=true`.
**Impact:** Future reviews will skip these files, saving time.

### 2. Planning Standards Enforcement
**Finding:** Planning documents must include "Estado Actual" section.
**Solution:** All 3 review plans include comprehensive Estado Actual.
**Impact:** Consistent planning approach across all reviews.

### 3. Documentation Quality Iterations
**Finding:** Quality improvements required 3 review cycles.
**Learning:** Each review catches deeper consistency issues.
**Outcome:** Final documentation meets maximum quality standards.

### 4. Planning Hub Pattern
**Finding:** Multiple reviews for single issue needed navigation.
**Solution:** This hub file (issue-540.md) provides centralized index.
**Impact:** Easier navigation, clearer history, better auditability.

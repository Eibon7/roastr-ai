## Executive Summary

CodeRabbit comment #3369275698 identifies **2 remaining documentation issues** in `docs/plan/review-3302415963.md`:

**Issue #1 (Major):** Conflicting response expectations (lines 91-152)
**Issue #2 (Minor):** Outdated status (lines 255-349)

**Previous Fix (Partial):** Commit `a2bbc7b9` addressed these issues in the main sections, but **4 residual references to `CHECK_FAILED`** remain in other parts of the document.

**This Plan:** Complete the cleanup by removing ALL ambiguous `CHECK_FAILED` references.

## FASE 0: Analysis of CodeRabbit Comment

### Context: Previous Partial Fix

**Commit a2bbc7b9** (CodeRabbit Review #3302504177) already fixed:

- ✅ Lines 91-152: Removed `CHECK_FAILED` from Expected Fix section
- ✅ Lines 134-147: Removed `CHECK_FAILED` from Analysis section
- ✅ Lines 205-207: Removed `CHECK_FAILED` from diff section
- ✅ Lines 342-344: Updated status to "Implementation Complete"

**However, 4 residual `CHECK_FAILED` references remain:**

### Issue #1: Remaining CHECK_FAILED References (Major)

**Locations:**

1. **Line 54:** CodeRabbit comment blockquote (original suggestion)
2. **Line 160:** Risk Assessment section (mentions both alternatives)
3. **Line 218:** Validation comments (suggests both alternatives)
4. **Line 225:** Adjust Expectation section (suggests checking both)

**Why This Matters (Points 2 & 3 - Most Important):**

**Point 2 - Architectural Clarity:**

- The document creates **ambiguity** about expected behavior
- Readers may think the implementation is uncertain or flaky
- **Truth:** AC6 test ALWAYS returns `AUTOPOST_DISABLED` (proven in commit 4a2b0e59)
- The `handleMissingFlag()` defense-in-depth architecture guarantees this behavior

**Point 3 - Code Quality Impact:**

- Ambiguous docs → developers may add conditional logic for both cases
- This adds unnecessary complexity to test assertions
- Could lead to "flaky test" perception when behavior is actually deterministic
- Violates "single source of truth" principle

**Root Cause:**

- Early planning assumed `CHECK_FAILED` might occur if exception propagates
- After implementation, we confirmed `handleMissingFlag()` catches all DB errors
- Planning doc wasn't fully updated to reflect actual behavior

---

## FASE 1: GDD Design Analysis

### Nodes Affected

**None.** This is a documentation-only fix in planning document.

**No architectural changes required.**

---

## FASE 2: Subagents Assignment

**None required.** This is a simple documentation cleanup (orchestrator can handle).

**Reasoning:**

- No code changes
- No test changes
- No security implications
- Simple find-and-replace + clarification

---

## FASE 3: Files Affected

### Files to Modify

1. **docs/plan/review-3302415963.md** (4 locations)
   - Line 54: Update CodeRabbit comment citation (clarify actual vs suggested)
   - Line 160: Remove ambiguous alternative from Risk Assessment
   - Line 218: Clarify validation comments
   - Line 225: Remove "adjust expectation" step (not needed)

2. **docs/plan/review-3369275698.md** (this file)
   - New planning document

---

## FASE 4: Implementation Strategy

### Changes Required

#### Location 1: Line 54 (CodeRabbit Comment Citation)

**Current:**

```markdown
> Then assert `{ blocked: true, reason: 'CHECK_FAILED' }` or similar.
```

**Fix:**
Add clarification that this was CodeRabbit's initial suggestion, but actual behavior differs:

```markdown
> Then assert `{ blocked: true, reason: 'CHECK_FAILED' }` or similar.

**Note:** CodeRabbit's initial suggestion assumed exception might propagate to `shouldBlockAutopost()` catch block. However, actual implementation shows `handleMissingFlag()` catches all DB errors first, returning `AUTOPOST_DISABLED`. See analysis below for confirmed behavior.
```

#### Location 2: Line 160 (Risk Assessment)

**Current:**

```markdown
- **Low risk:** Same fix pattern as successfully applied AC5 test
- Test may return `AUTOPOST_DISABLED` (handleMissingFlag) or `CHECK_FAILED` (catch block)
- Both are acceptable fail-safe behaviors
```

**Fix:**

```markdown
- **Low risk:** Same fix pattern as successfully applied AC5 test
- Test returns `AUTOPOST_DISABLED` via `handleMissingFlag()` defense-in-depth
- Deterministic fail-safe behavior (confirmed in commit 4a2b0e59)
```

#### Location 3: Line 218 (Validation Comments)

**Current:**

```markdown
# Expected: PASS with reason='AUTOPOST_DISABLED' (based on AC5 behavior)

# or reason='CHECK_FAILED' (if different code path)
```

**Fix:**

```markdown
# Expected: PASS with reason='AUTOPOST_DISABLED' (same as AC5 behavior)

# Defense-in-depth: handleMissingFlag() catches DB errors before propagation
```

#### Location 4: Lines 224-227 (Adjust Expectation Section)

**Current:**

```markdown
### Step 3: Adjust Expectation if Needed

Based on test results:

- If returns `AUTOPOST_DISABLED`: Keep current expectation
- If returns `CHECK_FAILED`: Update expectation to match
- Both are correct fail-safe behaviors
```

**Fix:**
Remove this section entirely (step is unnecessary - behavior is deterministic):

````markdown
### Step 3: Verify Test Passes

```bash
# Verify AC6 test passes with AUTOPOST_DISABLED
npm test -- killSwitch-issue-414.test.js -t "AC6.*should fail closed"

# Expected: PASS with reason='AUTOPOST_DISABLED' (deterministic behavior)
```
````

## FASE 5: Success Criteria

### CodeRabbit Resolution

- ✅ Issue #1 (Major): All `CHECK_FAILED` ambiguity removed
- ✅ Issue #2 (Minor): Status already updated to "Implementation Complete" (commit a2bbc7b9)

**Total:** 2/2 issues resolved (100%)

### Quality Standards

- ✅ 100% comments resolved
- ✅ Documentation accurately reflects implementation
- ✅ No ambiguity about expected behavior
- ✅ Single source of truth maintained
- ✅ No regressions (doc-only changes)

---

## FASE 6: Testing and Validation Plan

### Pre-Implementation Validation

**None required** - documentation-only changes.

### Post-Implementation Validation

#### Manual verification:
1. Search for remaining `CHECK_FAILED` references
2. Verify all removed or clarified
3. Verify document tells consistent story

```bash
# Should return 0 or only clarified references
grep -n "CHECK_FAILED" docs/plan/review-3302415963.md
````

#### No automated testing needed.

## FASE 7: Evidence and Documentation

### Test Evidence

**Not applicable** - documentation-only change

### spec.md Updates

**Not required** - this is a tactical documentation fix in planning doc, not architectural change.

---

## FASE 8: Commit Strategy

### Commit Message Template

```text
docs: Complete CodeRabbit comment #3369275698 - Remove CHECK_FAILED ambiguity

### Issues Addressed
- 🟠 Major: Conflicting response expectations (docs/plan/review-3302415963.md)
- 🟢 Minor: Outdated status (ALREADY FIXED in a2bbc7b9)

### Changes

**Documentation Clarity (Points 2 & 3 - Architectural Truth):**

This completes the fix started in commit a2bbc7b9. While that commit removed
`CHECK_FAILED` from main sections (lines 91-152, 134-147, 205-207), 4 residual
references remained that created ambiguity about expected behavior.

**Why This Matters (Point 2 - Architecture):**
- AC6 test behavior is DETERMINISTIC, not uncertain
- `handleMissingFlag()` defense-in-depth ALWAYS catches DB errors
- Result is ALWAYS `AUTOPOST_DISABLED`, never `CHECK_FAILED`
- Confirmed in implementation (commit 4a2b0e59) and test execution

**Why This Matters (Point 3 - Code Quality):**
- Ambiguous docs → developers think behavior is flaky
- Could lead to unnecessary conditional logic in assertions
- Violates "single source of truth" principle
- Creates false perception of implementation uncertainty

**Locations Fixed:**
1. Line 54: Added clarification note to CodeRabbit comment citation
2. Line 160: Removed ambiguous alternative from Risk Assessment
3. Line 218: Clarified validation comments (deterministic behavior)
4. Lines 224-227: Replaced "Adjust Expectation" with "Verify Test Passes"

**Result:** Planning document now accurately reflects deterministic implementation.

### Testing
- Manual verification: grep for remaining CHECK_FAILED references
- No code changes (doc-only)
- No test changes required

### GDD
- No nodes affected (planning doc cleanup)
- No spec.md updates needed

### Files Modified

## FASE 0: Analysis of CodeRabbit Comments

### Issue #1: Markdown Linting Regressions in Snippet (REQUIRES FIX ⚠️)

**File:** docs/plan/review-3302460426.md
**Lines:** 76-99 (snippet documenting previous fix)
**Severity:** 🟡 Minor
**Category:** Documentation Quality / Linting
**Tool:** markdownlint-cli2 (0.18.1)
**Rules:** MD036 (no-emphasis-as-heading), MD040 (fenced-code-language)

**Issue Description:**
A code snippet in the planning document shows the "Expected Fix" for the previous review. This snippet contains bold text (`**Step X:**`) and nested code fences (` ```bash `), which are being parsed by the linter and triggering errors.

**CodeRabbit Comment:**
> **Fix markdownlint regressions in the snippet.**
> This snippet currently fires markdownlint MD036 (Line 82) and MD040 (Lines 99, 132). The bold-only lines (`**Step X …**`) and the nested code fences without their own info string mean this planning doc fails the linter, defeating the purpose of documenting the fix. Please escape those `**Step …**` lines or wrap the whole excerpt in a higher-level fenced block (e.g., use four backticks) so the inner ` ```bash` blocks keep their language tags and the bold text is rendered literally.

**Current Code (Lines 76-99):**
The snippet shows markdown code within a ` ```markdown ` fence, but the inner bold/code is being parsed.

**Root Cause:**
When documenting markdown fixes, the example code is being treated as real markdown rather than literal text to display.

**Solution Options:**

**Option 1: Use 4 backticks for outer fence (RECOMMENDED)**
- Outer fence: ```` (4 backticks)
- Inner fences: ``` (3 backticks)
- This prevents inner content from being parsed

**Option 2: Escape bold markers**
- Change `**Step 1:**` to `\*\*Step 1:\*\*`
- More error-prone and harder to read

**Expected Fix (Option 1):**
Use 4 backticks for the outer fence so inner content is treated literally.

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** Minor (linting compliance)
- **Scope:** Lines 76-99 in planning document
- **Risk:** None (cosmetic fix for CI pipeline)
- **Urgency:** Low (prevents markdownlint errors)

## FASE 1: GDD Design Analysis

### Nodes Affected

**Primary:** None (documentation-only change)

**Analysis:**
- This is a pure documentation fix in `docs/plan/review-3302460426.md`
- No GDD nodes are affected by this change
- No architectural changes required
- No spec.md updates needed

### Dependencies

**None.** This is an isolated documentation linting fix.

---

## FASE 2: Subagents Assignment

### Required Agents

**None.** This is a trivial markdown linting fix that doesn't require specialized agents.

**Reasoning:**
- No security implications → No Security Audit needed
- No code changes → No Back-end Dev needed
- No UI changes → No Front-end Dev or UI Designer needed
- No test changes → No Test Engineer needed
- Simple linting fix → No Documentation Agent needed (orchestrator can handle)

---

## FASE 3: Files Affected

### Files to Modify

1. **docs/plan/review-3302460426.md** (lines 76-99, possibly more)
   - Change: Use 4 backticks for outer fence
   - Impact: Markdown linting compliance only
   - No dependent files affected

2. **docs/plan/review-3302467241.md** (this file)
   - New planning document
   - No impact on other files

### Files to Create

- None (only updating existing file)

### Tests to Create/Update

- None (documentation-only change)

---

## FASE 4: Implementation Strategy

### Order of Execution

**Step 1:** Identify all affected snippets
- Find all markdown code blocks with nested content
- Lines 76-99 are explicitly mentioned
- Check line 132 also mentioned

**Step 2:** Apply 4-backtick solution
- Change outer fence from ` ``` ` to ````
- Keep inner content unchanged
- Verify visual appearance identical

**Step 3:** Validate with markdownlint
- Run markdownlint on modified file
- Confirm MD036 and MD040 errors resolved

### Commit Grouping Strategy

**Single commit:** All changes are related (one linting fix in same file)

### Testing Strategy

**Validation:**
- Run markdownlint-cli2 on docs/plan/review-3302460426.md
- Verify MD036 error no longer appears (line 82)
- Verify MD040 errors no longer appear (lines 99, 132)
- Confirm no other linting errors introduced

**No automated tests required** - documentation-only change

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli2 docs/plan/review-3302460426.md
# Expected: No MD036 or MD040 errors from snippet
```

**Pattern search:**
```bash
# Search for other markdown snippets with nested content
grep -n '```markdown' docs/plan/*.md
```

- Working directory: Roast.md changes staged for review
- Last commit: Previous CodeRabbit review changes applied
- Health score: 88.7/100 (target: maintain or improve)
- All tests: 178/178 passing ‚úÖ

### Nodo Afectado: roast

- **Current Coverage:** 0% (managed by automation via
  "Coverage Source: auto")
- **Health Score:** 86/100 (healthy status)
- **Protected:** Yes (GDD 2.0 Maintenance Mode - Phase 18 Operational
  Freeze)

**Agent Roster Current State:**

- Listed: Backend Developer, Documentation Agent, Orchestrator,
  Test Engineer
- All 4 agents confirmed as actively used in Issue #540
- No additions or removals needed

**Duplicate Coverage Assessment:**

- Review flagged potential duplicate Coverage lines (0% and 50%)
- Current HEAD verification: Only ONE Coverage line found (line 8: 0%)
- Status: Duplicate already resolved or never existed in HEAD

**Risk Assessment:**

- **Impact:** Low - Documentation-only changes (2 lines in roast.md)
- **Regression Risk:** Minimal - No code changes, no dependency edge
  impacts
- **Validation:** GDD validation expected to pass, health score to
  maintain at 88.7/100
- **Scope:** Tactical naming consistency improvements only

**Quality Baseline:**

- GDD validation: Currently passing for roast node
- No orphan nodes, no cycles, no broken links
- Coverage authenticity: Compliant ("Coverage Source: auto")
- spec.md: Unchanged (no architectural modifications)

## 1. Analysis of Comments

### By Severity

#### Nit (1)

**N1: Unify role naming (docs/nodes/roast.md:4, 636)**

- **Issue:** Inconsistency between "Owner: Back-end Dev" and
  "Maintained by: Back-end Dev Agent"
- **Suggestion:** Standardize naming (e.g., "Backend Developer"
  consistently)
- **Impact:** Low - Documentation consistency
- **Type:** Style/Documentation

### Informational/Verification (5)

**V1: Verify agent roster (docs/nodes/roast.md:620-624)**

- **Issue:** Confirm agents listed in "Agentes Relevantes" are actually
  invoked
- **Current List:** Backend Developer, Documentation Agent, Orchestrator,
  Test Engineer
- **Action:** Verify and remove any not relevant

#### V2-V4: Health snapshot consistency

- **Files:** gdd-health.json, docs/system-health.md
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Verified consistent - no action needed

#### V5: Node score updates internally consistent

- **Nodes:** queue-system, roast, social-platforms
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Verified consistent - no action needed

### Duplicate/Resolved (1)

**D1: Duplicate coverage entries (docs/nodes/roast.md:8-15)**

- **Issue:** Two manual coverage lines (0% and 50%)
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Only one Coverage line found in current HEAD
  (line 8: 0%)
- **Action:** Verify no duplicates exist; if found in diff, remove

## 2. Categorization by Type

| Category | Count | Issues |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Documentation Style | 1 | N1 (naming consistency) |
| Documentation Quality | 1 | V1 (agent roster verification) |
| Data Consistency | 4 | V2-V5 (verified OK) |
| Coverage Integrity | 1 | D1 (duplicate - possibly resolved) |

---

## 3. GDD Design

### Nodes Affected

**Primary:**

- `roast` - Main node requiring updates

**Related (no changes needed):**

- `gdd-health` - Generated file, consistent ‚úÖ
- `system-health` - Generated file, consistent ‚úÖ

### Node Analysis

**`roast` Node Status:**

- **Current Coverage:** 0% (auto)
- **Last Updated:** 2025-10-13
- **Protected:** Yes (GDD 2.0 Maintenance Mode)
- **Agents Listed:** Backend Developer, Documentation Agent, Orchestrator,
  Test Engineer

**Validation:**

1. ‚úÖ Coverage Source: auto (correct)
2. ‚úÖ No duplicate coverage lines in HEAD
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Naming inconsistency: "Owner: Back-end Dev" vs
   "Maintained by: Back-end Dev Agent"
4. ‚ùì Agent roster needs verification

**Dependencies (edges):**

```text
roast ‚Üí persona
roast ‚Üí tone
roast ‚Üí platform-constraints
roast ‚Üí shield
roast ‚Üí cost-control
```

**Impact:** Changes are cosmetic; no dependency edges affected.

## 4. Subagents Assignment

| Issue | Agent | Justification |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| N1 (naming) | Documentation Agent | Style/consistency fix |
| V1 (agent roster) | Orchestrator | Knows which agents invoked |
| D1 (coverage) | Documentation Agent | GDD node maintenance |

**Agents NOT needed:**

- Security Audit (no security issues)
- Backend Developer (no code changes)
- Test Engineer (no test changes)
- UI Designer (no UI changes)

---

## 5. Files Affected

### To Modify

**docs/nodes/roast.md** (+2/-2 lines estimated)

- Line 4: Update "Owner: Back-end Dev" ‚Üí "Owner: Backend Developer"
- Line 636: Update "Maintained by: Back-end Dev Agent" ‚Üí
  "Maintained by: Backend Developer"
- Lines 619-622: Verify agent roster, update if needed

**Impact on dependents:** None (cosmetic changes only)

### Tests

**No new tests required** - Documentation-only changes.

**Validation:**

- Run GDD validation: `node scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js --node=roast`
- Verify no regressions: `node scripts/score-gdd-health.js --ci`

---

## 6. Implementation Strategy

### Order of Application

#### Phase 1: Verification (5 min)

1. Check if duplicate coverage entries exist in diff
2. Verify current agent roster against actual usage
3. Confirm naming inconsistencies

#### Phase 2: Apply Fixes (5 min)

1. Fix N1: Standardize naming to "Backend Developer"
2. Fix V1: Update agent roster if needed
3. Fix D1: Remove any duplicate coverage lines (if found)

#### Phase 3: Validation (5 min)

1. Run GDD node validation
2. Verify health score maintained
3. Check for any regressions

#### Phase 4: Documentation (5 min)

1. Create test evidences in `docs/test-evidence/review-3332341165/`
2. Update changelog
3. Commit with proper format

### Commit Grouping

**Single commit:** All changes are related (documentation consistency in
single file).

**Commit message format:**

```text
docs(gdd): Apply CodeRabbit Review #3332341165 - Roast node fixes

### Issues Addressed
- [Nit] Unify role naming ("Owner" vs "Maintained by")
  (roast.md:4,636)
- [Verification] Confirm agent roster reflects actual usage
  (roast.md:620)
- [Resolved] No duplicate coverage entries found in HEAD

### Changes
- roast.md: Standardized naming to "Backend Developer"
- roast.md: Verified agent roster is current and accurate

### Testing
- GDD validation: node passed
- Health score: maintained at 88.7/100
- No regressions detected

### GDD
- Updated node: roast
- spec.md: N/A (tactical changes only)

## 8. Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** üü¢ **LOW**

**Rationale:**

- Changes are cosmetic (naming/consistency)
- No code modifications
- No dependency impacts
- No test changes required
- Single file affected

**Mitigation:**

- Verify GDD validation passes
- Confirm health score unchanged
- Review diff before commit

## 9. Estimated Effort

| Phase | Duration | Complexity |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Verification | 5 min | Low |
| Implementation | 5 min | Low |
| Validation | 5 min | Low |
| Documentation | 5 min | Low |
| **Total** | **20 min** | **Low** |

## 10. Agent Roster Verification (roast node)

**Current List:**

- Backend Developer
- Documentation Agent
- Orchestrator
- Test Engineer

**Verification Against Recent Work:**

**Issue #540 (this PR):**

- ‚úÖ Orchestrator: Coordinated review response ‚úì
- ‚úÖ Test Engineer: Created 139 tests (tierValidation,
  inputValidation, i18n) ‚úì
- ‚úÖ Backend Developer: Fixed inputValidation bugs ‚úì
- ‚úÖ Documentation Agent: Updated GDD nodes ‚úì

**Conclusion:** All 4 agents are relevant and have been invoked for
roast-related work. No changes needed.

## 12. Notes

**CodeRabbit Review Context:**

- Review was on commits between `0c1c7d5a` and `4514bcee` (possible
  remote commits not in local HEAD)
- Most issues are verification/informational
- Only 1 actionable change (naming consistency)
- All generated files (gdd-health.json, system-health.md) are already
  consistent

**Special Considerations:**

- Node is Protected (GDD Maintenance Mode) - verify protection doesn't
  block edits
- Health score is at 88.7/100 (above threshold 88) - must maintain or
  improve

---

**Status:** ‚úÖ Planning Complete - Ready to proceed with implementation

**Next Step:** Phase 1 - Verification

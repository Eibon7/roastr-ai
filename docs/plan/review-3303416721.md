## 2. Issues Detallados

### Issue 1: Restore Assertions on Job Shape (‚ö†Ô∏è Outside Diff - Tests)

**File:** `tests/unit/services/queueService.test.js`
**Lines:** 164-247
**Category:** Test Coverage Regression
**Severity:** Outside Diff (High Priority)

#### Problem Description

After refactoring `QueueService.addJob` to return normalized `{ success, jobId, job, queuedTo }`, the tests were updated to only assert the new return structure. However, this removed critical assertions that guaranteed the **job payload itself** was built correctly with:
- `job_type`
- `organization_id`
- `priority`
- `payload`
- `max_attempts`

**Current test (insufficient):**
```javascript
const result = await queueService.addJob('fetch_comments', jobData, { priority: 2 });

expect(result.success).toBe(true);
expect(result.jobId).toBeDefined();
// ‚ùå Missing: assertions on job structure
```

**Risk:** A regression in job payload construction would now slip through even though test names claim we're checking those properties.

#### Solution

Inspect the spy arguments to validate the job object passed to `addJobToRedis` or `addJobToDatabase`:

```javascript
const result = await queueService.addJob('fetch_comments', jobData, { priority: 2 });

expect(result.success).toBe(true);
expect(result.jobId).toBeDefined();

// ‚úÖ Also validate the job payload via spy
const [jobArg] = queueService.addJobToRedis.mock.calls[0];
expect(jobArg).toMatchObject({
  job_type: 'fetch_comments',
  organization_id: 'org-123',
  priority: 2,
  payload: jobData,
  max_attempts: 3
});
```

#### Affected Tests (lines 164-247)

1. **Test: "should create job with correct properties"** (lines 172-204)
   - Add spy assertions for: `job_type`, `organization_id`, `priority`, `payload`, `max_attempts`

2. **Test: "should use default priority when not specified"** (lines 206-227)
   - Add spy assertions to validate `priority: 5` (default)

3. **Test: "should set correct max attempts"** (lines 229-246)
   - Add spy assertions to validate `max_attempts: 5` (custom)

4. **Test: "should fallback to database when Redis unavailable"** (lines 248-264)
   - Add spy assertions on `addJobToDatabase` mock instead of `addJobToRedis`

#### Implementation Strategy

- Keep existing assertions on `result.{ success, jobId, job, queuedTo }`
- Add new assertions using `queueService.addJobToRedis.mock.calls[0][0]` to validate job payload
- For database fallback test, use `queueService.addJobToDatabase.mock.calls[0][0]`
- Use `toMatchObject()` for flexible matching (allows extra fields)

### Issue 2: Fix Markdown List Indentation (üßπ Nit - Docs)

**File:** `docs/plan/review-3303223154.md`
**Lines:** 183-184 (reported), potentially 183-200
**Category:** Code Quality - Linting
**Severity:** Nit
**Tool:** markdownlint-cli2 (MD007, ul-indent)

#### Problem Description

Unordered list indentation is inconsistent:
- Expected: 0 spaces
- Actual: 3 spaces

This causes markdownlint failures and reduces documentation quality.

#### Solution

Align all bullets in the affected section (lines 183-200) to start at column 0 (no indentation).

**Before:**
```markdown
   - Item 1
   - Item 2
```

**After:**
```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
```

#### Implementation Strategy

- Read `docs/plan/review-3303223154.md` lines 170-210 for context
- Fix indentation for lines 183-200
- Run `npx markdownlint-cli2 docs/plan/review-3303223154.md` to validate fix

## 3. Dise√±o GDD (Graph Driven Development)

### Nodos Afectados

| Node | Impact | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| `queue-system` | Low (tests only) | Test coverage improvement, no architectural change |

### Edge Validation

No edges affected - this is a test-only change with minor docs cleanup.

### Node Updates Required

**None.** This review addresses:
- Test coverage regression (restoring existing assertions)
- Documentation linting (cosmetic fix)

No architectural changes, no spec.md updates needed.

---

## 4. Subagentes a Usar

| Agent | Usage | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Test Engineer** | Primary | Restore test assertions for job shape validation |
| **Documentation** | Secondary | Fix markdown linting issues |

**No need for:**
- Security Audit (no security issues)
- Back-end Dev (no code changes, only test assertions)
- Front-end Dev (no UI)
- UI Designer (no UI)

---

## 5. Archivos Afectados

### Modified Files

| File | Lines | Change Type | Impact |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| `tests/unit/services/queueService.test.js` | 164-247 | Add spy assertions | Test coverage ‚¨ÜÔ∏è |
| `docs/plan/review-3303223154.md` | 183-200 | Fix indentation | Linting ‚úÖ |

### Dependents

**None.** These are test and documentation files with no runtime dependencies.

## 6. Estrategia de Implementaci√≥n

### Order of Application

1. **Issue 2 (Nit - Docs)** - Quick win, independent
2. **Issue 1 (Outside Diff - Tests)** - Main work, requires careful assertion design

### Commit Grouping

**Single commit** - Both issues are small and related to CodeRabbit review cleanup:
```
test: Apply CodeRabbit Review #3303416721 - Restore job shape assertions + fix docs linting

### Issues Addressed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Outside Diff: Restore assertions on job shape in queueService.test.js (lines 164-247)
- üßπ Nit: Fix Markdown list indentation in review-3303223154.md (MD007)

### Changes
- tests/unit/services/queueService.test.js: Added spy assertions to validate job payload structure
- docs/plan/review-3303223154.md: Fixed unordered list indentation (0 spaces expected)

### Testing
- Validated job_type, organization_id, priority, payload, max_attempts in all relevant tests
- Ran markdownlint-cli2 to confirm MD007 fix

```

### Testing Plan

**Per Issue:**

**Issue 1 (Tests):**
```bash
# Run affected test suite
npm test -- tests/unit/services/queueService.test.js

# Verify all tests pass
# Expected: 18/18 passing (existing count)

# Check that new assertions validate job structure
# Expected: Tests should fail if job payload is malformed
```

**Issue 2 (Docs):**
```bash
# Run markdown linter
npx markdownlint-cli2 docs/plan/review-3303223154.md

# Expected: 0 errors (MD007 fixed)
```

**Full validation:**
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run test:coverage
```

## 7. Criterios de √âxito

### Must Pass (100%)

- ‚úÖ **Issue 1:** All 4 affected tests now validate job payload structure via spy assertions
- ‚úÖ **Issue 2:** markdownlint MD007 error resolved
- ‚úÖ **Tests:** 100% passing (`npm test`)
- ‚úÖ **Linting:** 0 errors (`npm run lint`)
- ‚úÖ **Coverage:** Maintained or improved (test assertions added)
- ‚úÖ **No regressions:** All existing tests still pass

## 8. GDD Impact Assessment

### Nodes to Update

**None.** This is a tactical fix with no architectural impact.

### spec.md Updates

**None.** No public API changes, no contract modifications.

### Documentation Updates

- ‚úÖ This planning document (`docs/plan/review-3303416721.md`)
- ‚úÖ Test evidence in `docs/test-evidence/review-3303416721/`
- ‚úÖ Fix existing docs linting issue in `docs/plan/review-3303223154.md`

## 9. Risk Assessment

### Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Spy assertions too strict | Low | Use `toMatchObject()` instead of `toEqual()` |
| Breaking existing tests | Low | Run full test suite before commit |
| Markdown fix breaks formatting | Very Low | Visual inspection after edit |

### Rollback Plan

If tests fail unexpectedly:
1. Revert commit: `git revert HEAD`
2. Re-analyze spy mock structure
3. Adjust assertions and re-test

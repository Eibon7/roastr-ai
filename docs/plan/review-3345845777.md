## Current State Analysis

### M1: Duplicate Coverage Metadata (REAL ‚ùå)

**Issue:** Multiple node files have duplicate `**Coverage:**` lines

**Affected Files (4):**
1. `docs/nodes/social-platforms.md` - 5 Coverage lines (8, 11-14)
2. `docs/nodes/cost-control.md` - 5 Coverage lines (8, 11-14)
3. `docs/nodes/roast.md` - 5 Coverage lines (8, 14-17)
4. `docs/nodes/observability.md` - 2 Coverage lines (170, 205) - DIFFERENT CONTEXT

**Example Pattern (social-platforms.md lines 8-14):**
```markdown
**Coverage:** 0%
**Coverage Source:** auto
**Related PRs:** #499
**Coverage:** 50%  # DUPLICATE
**Coverage:** 50%  # DUPLICATE
**Coverage:** 50%  # DUPLICATE
**Coverage:** 50%  # DUPLICATE
```

**Root Cause:**
Likely caused by merge conflicts or manual edit errors during previous reviews. Multiple Coverage lines were added instead of replacing the existing one.

**Fix Strategy:**
Delete lines 11-14 in each affected file, keeping ONLY:
- Line 8: `**Coverage:** 0%`
- Line 9: `**Coverage Source:** auto`

**Note on observability.md:**
Lines 170 and 205 appear to be TEST COUNTS not coverage percentages:
```markdown
Line 170: **Coverage:** 19 tests across 8 suites (100% passing)
Line 205: **Coverage:** 17 tests across 5 acceptance criteria (100% passing)
```
These are NOT duplicates of the coverage percentage - they're additional test metadata. Need to verify if these should remain or be removed.

### M2: Terminology Inconsistency (PRE-RESOLVED ‚úÖ)

**File:** `docs/system-validation.md`
**CodeRabbit Issue:** Says "currently X%" should be "declared: X%, actual: N/A"

**Current State Verification:**
```bash
$ grep -n "currently" docs/system-validation.md
# Result: NO MATCHES (0 lines)
```

**Actual Content (lines 73-85):**
```markdown
| analytics | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |
| billing | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |
| cost-control | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: N/A, actual: N/A) |
...
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED in Review #3345744075 (commit aca9591a)

**No Action Required** - CodeRabbit generated this review before the fix was applied.

---

### C1: SUMMARY vs Docs Mismatch (PRE-RESOLVED ‚úÖ)

**File:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3345744075/SUMMARY.md`
**CodeRabbit Issue:** SUMMARY claims 10 nodes updated but docs still use "currently"

**Current State:**
- SUMMARY.md correctly documents 10 nodes updated
- docs/system-validation.md ALSO correctly uses "declared/actual"
- Both are now aligned ‚úÖ

**Status:** ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED in Review #3345744075 (commit aca9591a)

**No Action Required** - This was the same issue as M2, resolved together.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: M1 - Remove Coverage Duplicates (10 minutes)

**Fix 1: social-platforms.md**
```bash
# Lines to DELETE: 11-14
# Keep: Line 8 (Coverage: 0%) + Line 9 (Coverage Source: auto)
```

**Edit:**
```markdown
# DELETE lines 11-14:
**Coverage:** 50%
**Coverage:** 50%
**Coverage:** 50%
**Coverage:** 50%

# KEEP:
**Coverage:** 0%
**Coverage Source:** auto
```

**Fix 2: cost-control.md**
```bash
# Same pattern: DELETE lines 11-14
```

**Fix 3: roast.md**
```bash
# Lines to DELETE: 14-17
# Note: Different line numbers but same pattern
```

**Fix 4: observability.md - VERIFY FIRST**
```bash
# Lines 170, 205: Check if these are test counts or coverage duplicates
# If test counts ‚Üí KEEP
# If coverage duplicates ‚Üí DELETE extras
```

---

### Phase 2: M2 + C1 - Document Pre-Resolution (5 minutes)

**No code changes required.**

Create evidence documenting that M2 and C1 were already resolved in review #3345744075.

**Verification:**
```bash
# M2: No "currently" in system-validation.md
$ grep -c "currently" docs/system-validation.md
# Expected: 0

# C1: Both SUMMARY and docs aligned
$ grep "declared.*actual" docs/system-validation.md | wc -l
# Expected: 13 (all drift recommendations)
```

**Evidence File:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3345845777/m2-c1-pre-resolved.txt`

## GDD Impact

**Nodes Affected:** 4 (social-platforms, cost-control, roast, observability)
**Type:** Metadata cleanup (remove duplicates)

**Files Modified:**
1. `docs/nodes/social-platforms.md` - Remove 4 duplicate Coverage lines
2. `docs/nodes/cost-control.md` - Remove 4 duplicate Coverage lines
3. `docs/nodes/roast.md` - Remove 4 duplicate Coverage lines
4. `docs/nodes/observability.md` - Verify and potentially remove duplicates

**Validation Required:**
- ‚úÖ No GDD node architecture changes
- ‚úÖ No health score impact (metadata cleanup)
- ‚úÖ No coverage changes (just removing duplicates)
- ‚úÖ No tests required (documentation only)
- ‚úÖ GDD validation should pass after cleanup

---

## Pattern Recognition

**Pattern:** Duplicate Metadata from Merge Conflicts

**‚ùå Mistake:**
- Merge conflicts result in duplicate metadata lines
- Manual edits add instead of replace
- No validation to catch duplicate Coverage lines

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- Always verify only ONE Coverage line exists
- Remove all duplicates, keep earliest valid entry
- Ensure Coverage Source is set to "auto"

**üìè Rule:**
**"Each GDD node must have exactly ONE Coverage line + ONE Coverage Source line"**

**Prevention:**
- Add validation script to detect duplicate Coverage metadata
- Pre-commit hook to check for duplicate node metadata
- GDD validator to flag multiple Coverage lines

---

## Validation Commands

**No test execution required** (documentation-only changes)

**Verification:**
```bash
# M1: Check no duplicates remain
for file in docs/nodes/social-platforms.md docs/nodes/cost-control.md docs/nodes/roast.md; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  grep -c "^\*\*Coverage:\*\*" "$file"
  # Expected: 1 (only one Coverage line)
done

# M2: Verify no "currently" in system-validation.md
grep -c "currently" docs/system-validation.md
# Expected: 0

# C1: Verify declared/actual terminology
grep -c "declared.*actual" docs/system-validation.md
# Expected: 13
```

## Estado Actual

**Branch:** docs/issue-413-billing-evidences
**Base Assessment:**
- Previous reviews applied successfully (#3393621565, #3327569755, #3327587218, #3327592440, #3327608415, #3327621292, #3327638072)
- This review (#3327653194) contains 1 Major issue (scope creep)
- Issue: SUMMARY for review-3327638072 references files outside Issue #413 scope
- Context: Review-3327638072 was about fixing MD036 violations in *previous review planning docs*
- Problem: Those planning docs (review-3327592440, review-3327608415, review-3327621292) are CodeRabbit review artifacts, NOT Issue #413 billing evidences

**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ All previous issues: Resolved
- ‚úÖ MD036 violations: Fixed
- ‚úÖ File counts: Corrected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Major issue: 1 new (scope creep in review-3327638072 SUMMARY)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Review-3327638072 fixed MD036 violations in planning docs from *previous* reviews
- Those previous reviews were themselves CodeRabbit review implementations
- Chain of CodeRabbit reviews fixing CodeRabbit reviews = scope creep
- Issue #413 scope: Billing/Entitlements test evidences only
- These planning docs: NOT billing evidences, they're review implementation artifacts

### Por Severidad

#### üü† Major (1 actionable)

#### M1: Scope Exceeds Issue #413 Remit

- **Severity:** Major (üü†)
- **Type:** Documentation / Scope Alignment
- **File:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3327638072/SUMMARY.md`
- **Lines:** 42-55
- **Description:** SUMMARY lists unrelated prior review artifacts (docs/plan/review-3327592440.md, review-3327608415.md, review-3327621292.md) that exceed Issue #413 scope
- **Impact:** Scope creep already flagged on PR - acceptance package not focused
- **Root Cause:** Review-3327638072 fixed MD036 in planning docs from previous reviews, which are themselves review artifacts, not Issue #413 billing evidences
- **Fix:** Update SUMMARY to clarify these are meta-review artifacts OR remove them from this branch entirely

**Analysis:**
- Issue #413: "Billing/Entitlements test evidences"
- Files in question:
  - `docs/plan/review-3327592440.md` - Planning for CodeRabbit review fix
  - `docs/plan/review-3327608415.md` - Planning for CodeRabbit review fix
  - `docs/plan/review-3327621292.md` - Planning for CodeRabbit review fix
- These are NOT billing/entitlements evidences
- These ARE CodeRabbit review implementation artifacts

**Decision Required:**
1. **Option A:** Remove these files from branch (revert commits)
2. **Option B:** Update SUMMARY to clarify scope (meta-review documentation)
3. **Option C:** Split into separate branch/PR for review cleanup

**Recommended:** Option B - Update SUMMARY to clarify these are meta-review documentation artifacts that support the PR quality process, not primary Issue #413 deliverables

## 5. Estrategia de Implementaci√≥n

### Orden de Ejecuci√≥n

#### Phase 1: Clarify Scope in SUMMARY (M1)

**Approach:** Update SUMMARY to clearly separate:
1. **Primary deliverables** (Issue #413 billing evidences)
2. **Meta-review artifacts** (CodeRabbit review planning/fixes)

**Rationale:**
- These files ARE part of the branch (fixing MD036 violations)
- But they're NOT primary Issue #413 deliverables
- They're supporting documentation for PR quality process
- Clarify this distinction in SUMMARY

**Implementation:**
1. Add section explaining meta-review context
2. Separate primary deliverables from review artifacts
3. Update file counts to reflect categorization
4. Clarify total as "2 meta-review docs + 3 meta-review fixes"

#### Phase 2: Validation

1. Verify scope clarity
2. Confirm Issue #413 primary deliverables clearly identified
3. Confirm meta-review artifacts properly contextualized

#### Phase 3: Documentation & Commit

1. Create evidence directory
2. Document scope clarification
3. Single commit with SUMMARY update
4. Push to origin

### Agrupaci√≥n de Commits

- **Single commit** (scope clarification only)
- No separate commits needed

### Testing Strategy

- **Validation:** Manual review of scope clarity
- **Verification:** Check primary vs. meta-review separation
- **Regression:** None possible (documentation only)

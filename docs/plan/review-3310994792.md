## 1. Análisis de Comentarios

### Por Severidad

#### 🔴 Critical (1 issue)
1. **Staged-change detection broken** (`.github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml:101-106`)
   - **Issue:** `git diff --quiet` used AFTER `git add .`
   - **Problem:** Compares working tree against index, NOT staged changes
   - **Result:** With staged edits, working tree matches index → exits 0
   - **Consequence:** Workflow bails with `committed=false` even with real staged changes
   - **Impact:** **Auto-fix will NEVER produce commits** (completely broken)

#### ✅ Major: 0
#### 🟡 Minor: 0
#### 📌 Nit: 0

**Total Issues:** 1 Critical

### Por Categoría

- **Bugs:** 1 (Logic error - wrong git diff mode)
- **Architecture:** 0

## 2. Diseño GDD

### Nodos Afectados

**Análisis de impacto:**

This is a **tactical CI/CD workflow fix**, not a core system feature. Therefore:

- ✅ **No core GDD nodes affected**
- ✅ **No edges modified**
- ✅ **No architectural changes**

**Rationale:**
- `.github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml` is CI/CD infrastructure, not business logic
- Fix corrects git diff mode to detect staged changes
- No impact on business features or data flow
- No dependencies on `docs/nodes/*`

**GDD Status:** No node updates required (tactical git command fix)

### Dependency Validation

**Checked edges:**
- ✅ No business logic dependencies
- ✅ No cross-node impacts
- ✅ CI/CD workflow is isolated infrastructure

**Conclusion:** Safe to proceed with git diff fix.

## 3. Subagentes a Usar

### Assignment

| Agent | Responsibility | Reason |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| **Back-end Dev** | Apply git diff fix | Git/Bash expertise |

**Not Required:**
- ❌ Security Audit (no security issue)
- ❌ Front-end Dev (no UI)
- ❌ UI Designer (no UI)

---

## 4. Archivos Afectados

### Files to Modify

#### `.github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml`
- **Line:** 102 (single line change)
- **Change:** `git diff --quiet` → `git diff --cached --quiet`
- **Impact:** ✅ Staged changes now detected correctly

**Before (BROKEN):**
```yaml
git add .

# Check if there are changes to commit
if git diff --quiet; then  # ❌ WRONG - checks working tree vs index
  echo "No changes to commit"
  echo "committed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  exit 0
fi
```

**After (FIXED):**
```yaml
git add .

# Check if there are changes to commit
if git diff --cached --quiet; then  # ✅ CORRECT - checks staged changes
  echo "No changes to commit"
  echo "committed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  exit 0
fi
```

**Total Files:** 1
**Total Changes:** 1 line (git diff --quiet → git diff --cached --quiet)

---

## 5. Estrategia de Implementación

### Order of Application

**Single one-line fix:**
1. Change `git diff --quiet` to `git diff --cached --quiet`
2. Validate fix logic
3. Commit and push

**Grouping Strategy:**
- ✅ Single commit (critical bug fix)
- ✅ Clear commit message
- ✅ Minimal, surgical change

### Testing Plan

#### Understanding Git Diff Modes

**`git diff` (no flags):**
- Compares: Working tree vs Index
- Shows: Unstaged changes
- After `git add .`: Shows nothing (working tree = index)

**`git diff --quiet`:**
- Same as above, but silent (exit code only)
- Exit 0: No unstaged changes
- Exit 1: Unstaged changes present

**`git diff --cached` (or `--staged`):**
- Compares: Index vs HEAD
- Shows: Staged changes
- After `git add .`: Shows what will be committed

**`git diff --cached --quiet`:**
- Same as above, but silent (exit code only)
- Exit 0: No staged changes
- Exit 1: Staged changes present

#### Pre-Fix State (BROKEN)

**Scenario: Auto-fix makes changes**
```bash
# Auto-repair modifies docs/nodes/shield.md
echo "new content" >> docs/nodes/shield.md

# Workflow stages changes
git add .

# Check if there are changes (BROKEN)
git diff --quiet
# Compares: working tree vs index
# After git add: working tree = index
# Exit code: 0 (NO DIFFERENCES)

# Result: "No changes to commit"
echo "committed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
exit 0

# PROBLEM: Actual staged changes exist, but workflow exits
```

**Result:** ❌ Auto-fix NEVER commits (workflow always exits with "No changes")

#### Post-Fix State (CORRECT)

**Scenario: Auto-fix makes changes**
```bash
# Auto-repair modifies docs/nodes/shield.md
echo "new content" >> docs/nodes/shield.md

# Workflow stages changes
git add .

# Check if there are changes (FIXED)
git diff --cached --quiet
# Compares: index vs HEAD
# After git add: index has new content, HEAD doesn't
# Exit code: 1 (DIFFERENCES EXIST)

# Result: Check fails, continues to commit
git commit -m "..."

# Success: Changes committed
echo "committed=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
```

**Result:** ✅ Auto-fix commits staged changes correctly

#### Validation

| Scenario | git diff --quiet (BROKEN) | git diff --cached --quiet (FIXED) |
|----------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| No changes | Exit 0 → Skip commit ✅ | Exit 0 → Skip commit ✅ |
| Staged changes | Exit 0 → Skip commit ❌ | Exit 1 → Commit ✅ |

## 6. Implementation Details

### Current Code (BROKEN)

```yaml
- name: Commit fixes
  if: env.FIXES_APPLIED == 'true'
  run: |
    git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"

    git add .

    # Check if there are changes to commit
    if git diff --quiet; then  # ❌ WRONG
      echo "No changes to commit"
      echo "committed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      exit 0
    fi

    # (never reaches here when there are staged changes)
```

**Problem:**
- `git diff --quiet` compares working tree vs index
- After `git add .`, working tree matches index
- Command exits 0 even when index has changes vs HEAD
- Workflow incorrectly thinks there are no changes
- Auto-fix never commits anything

### Fixed Code (CORRECT)

```yaml
- name: Commit fixes
  if: env.FIXES_APPLIED == 'true'
  run: |
    git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"

    git add .

    # Check if there are changes to commit
    if git diff --cached --quiet; then  # ✅ CORRECT
      echo "No changes to commit"
      echo "committed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
      exit 0
    fi

    # Commit changes
    git commit -m "..."
```

**Fix:**
- `git diff --cached --quiet` compares index vs HEAD
- After `git add .`, index has changes that HEAD doesn't
- Command exits 1 when there are staged changes
- Workflow correctly proceeds to commit
- Auto-fix commits work as expected

### Git Diff Modes Summary

| Command | Compares | Use Case |
|---------|----------|----------|
| `git diff` | Working tree vs Index | Unstaged changes |
| `git diff --cached` | Index vs HEAD | Staged changes |
| `git diff HEAD` | Working tree vs HEAD | All local changes |

**After `git add .`:**
- `git diff` shows nothing (working tree = index)
- `git diff --cached` shows staged changes (index ≠ HEAD)
- `git diff HEAD` shows all changes (working tree ≠ HEAD)

**Correct choice:** `git diff --cached` (checks what will be committed)

---

## 7. Validation Strategy

### Pre-Flight Checks

**Test Git Diff Behavior:**
```bash
# Create test change
echo "test" >> test.txt

# Stage it
git add test.txt

# Test both commands
git diff --quiet && echo "No unstaged changes" || echo "Unstaged changes"
# Output: "No unstaged changes" (working tree = index)

git diff --cached --quiet && echo "No staged changes" || echo "Staged changes"
# Output: "Staged changes" (index ≠ HEAD)
```

### Post-Fix Validation

- ✅ `git diff --cached --quiet` detects staged changes correctly
- ✅ Workflow commits when auto-fix makes changes
- ✅ Workflow skips commit when no changes (both commands exit 0)
- ✅ No regression on "no changes" scenario

## 10. Commit Strategy

### Commit Message
```
fix(ci): Fix staged-change detection before commit - Review #3310994792

### Issues Addressed
- [Critical] Staged-change detection broken (.github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml:102)

### Problem
- git diff --quiet used AFTER git add .
- Compares working tree vs index, NOT staged changes
- After git add: working tree = index → exits 0
- Workflow incorrectly reports "No changes" even with staged changes
- Auto-fix will NEVER produce commits (completely broken)

### Root Cause
- Wrong git diff mode for staged change detection
- git diff --quiet checks unstaged changes (working tree vs index)
- Should use git diff --cached --quiet (index vs HEAD)

### Fix Applied
One-line change:

-if git diff --quiet; then
+if git diff --cached --quiet; then

### Git Diff Modes
- git diff: Working tree vs Index (unstaged changes)
- git diff --cached: Index vs HEAD (staged changes) ✅ CORRECT
- git diff HEAD: Working tree vs HEAD (all local changes)

After git add .:
- git diff exits 0 (working tree = index) ❌ WRONG
- git diff --cached exits 1 if changes staged ✅ CORRECT

### Impact
- ✅ Auto-fix now commits staged changes correctly
- ✅ Workflow detects what will be committed
- ✅ No regression on "no changes" scenario
- ✅ Critical functionality restored

### Files Modified
- .github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml (+1/-1 line)

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] Language identifier added to code fence
- [x] Markdown renders correctly
- [x] CodeRabbit comment resolved
- [x] 0 regressions (N/A for docs-only)

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** NONE
**Impact:** Documentation quality improvement
**Rollback:** Git revert (trivial)

---

## Subagent Assignments

**No agents required** - Trivial documentation fix handled by Orchestrator.

---

## GDD Impact Analysis

**No GDD nodes affected** - This is a documentation fix for a planning document that is not part of the system specification.

## Corrective Actions

**Pattern:** Missing language identifiers in code blocks
**Prevention:** Add to pre-commit checklist:
- [ ] All code blocks have language identifiers
- [ ] Use `text` for ASCII art/diagrams
- [ ] Use appropriate language for code snippets

1. Commit `f96876a0` - Merge with main
2. **CodeRabbit Review #3340734951** executed on commit `f96876a0`
3. Commit `8dbe9bc1` - Fixed test count issue

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify Integration Tests section (should show 19)
grep -n "Coverage:.*tests across" docs/nodes/observability.md
# Output: 170:**Coverage:** 19 tests across 8 suites (100% passing)

# Verify Health Metrics section (should show 19/19)
grep -n "Test Coverage:.*integration" docs/nodes/observability.md
# Output: 733:**Test Coverage:** 14% (19/19 integration tests + 17/17 E2E tests passing)

# Confirm consistency
grep -E "(19 tests|19/19 integration)" docs/nodes/observability.md
# Should find both occurrences with matching "19"
```

**Expected Result:** All commands show "19" consistently âœ…

## Lesson Learned

**Pattern:** "CodeRabbit Async Review Processing"

When multiple commits are pushed rapidly:
1. CodeRabbit may review commit N
2. Developer fixes issues in commit N+1
3. CodeRabbit reports issues on N (before processing N+1)
4. Result: Duplicate issue reports

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Always check current state before implementing:
git log --oneline -3
git show HEAD  # Verify latest commit
```

**Acceptance:** This is **normal CI/CD behavior**, not an error.

---

## Summary

**Status:** âœ… **NO ACTION REQUIRED**

- **Issue:** Test count inconsistency (19 vs 28)
- **Resolution:** Already fixed in commit `8dbe9bc1`
- **Current State:** Fully consistent (19/19 everywhere)
- **Next Step:** Wait for CodeRabbit to process latest commit

**User Action:** None. Ready to merge when CI passes and CodeRabbit catches up (with your explicit approval).

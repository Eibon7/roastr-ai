## Phase 7.1: System Health Recovery (October 6, 2025)

### 📋 Objective

Restore full documentary coherence in the GDD system by eliminating orphan nodes, adding missing spec.md references, and ensuring bidirectional relationships in system-map.yaml.

### 🎯 Goals

- Create complete system-map.yaml with all 13 nodes
- Eliminate all orphan nodes
- Add missing spec.md references
- Ensure bidirectional relationships
- Improve system health score

### 🔧 Implementation Details

#### System Map Enhancement

**Updated:** `docs/system-map.yaml`

Added complete node definitions with:
- **Bidirectional relationships**: `depends_on` and `used_by` for every node
- **Complete metadata**: status, priority, owner, last_updated, coverage
- **File mappings**: All implementation files linked to nodes
- **Validation rules**: bidirectional_check, cycle_detection, orphan_detection enabled

**Key Improvements:**
```yaml
nodes:
  roast:
    depends_on: [persona, tone, platform-constraints, shield, cost-control]
    used_by: [analytics, trainer]
    coverage: 85
    status: production

  # ... all 13 nodes with complete metadata
```

#### Spec.md Documentation

**Added:** Complete GDD Node Architecture Documentation section

**New Nodes Documented:**
1. **cost-control** - Usage tracking, billing integration, limit enforcement
2. **plan-features** - Subscription plan configuration and access control
3. **platform-constraints** - Platform-specific limits and style guides
4. **social-platforms** - 9 social media integrations
5. **trainer** - AI model fine-tuning (development status)

**Documentation Includes:**
- Purpose and responsibilities
- Dependencies and usage relationships
- Implementation details
- Plan tiers and platform support
- GDD node links

### 📊 Validation Results

**Before Phase 7.1:**
- ❌ 13 orphan nodes (no system-map.yaml entries)
- ❌ 5 missing spec.md references
- ⚠️ System status: WARNING
- Health score: 63.5/100

**After Phase 7.1:**
- ✅ 0 orphan nodes
- ✅ 0 missing references
- ✅ 0 cycles detected
- ✅ System status: HEALTHY
- Health score: 67.7/100

**Drift Risk Analysis:**
- Average drift risk: 17/100 (improved from 30/100)
- 🟢 Healthy nodes: 12/13
- 🟡 At-risk nodes: 1/13 (billing)
- 🔴 High-risk nodes: 0/13

### ✅ Success Criteria

**Validation Status:**
- ✅ system-map.yaml exists and valid
- ✅ No orphans or cycles
- ✅ spec.md fully synchronized
- ✅ Bidirectional edges verified
- ✅ All nodes linked and validated

**Current Status:**
```text
═══════════════════════════════════════
         VALIDATION SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════

✔ 13 nodes validated
✔ 0 orphans
✔ 0 missing references
✔ 0 cycles
✔ 0 drift issues

🟢 Overall Status: HEALTHY
```

### 📁 Files Modified

**Created/Updated:**
1. `docs/system-map.yaml` - Complete v2.0.0 with bidirectional relationships
2. `spec.md` - Added GDD Node Architecture Documentation section (+193 lines)
3. `docs/system-validation.md` - Updated validation report (HEALTHY status)
4. `gdd-status.json` - Clean validation status
5. `docs/drift-report.md` - Improved drift metrics
6. `gdd-drift.json` - Updated drift analysis
7. `docs/system-health.md` - Current health metrics
8. `gdd-health.json` - Detailed health breakdown

### 📈 Impact

**Documentary Coherence:**
- All 13 nodes properly mapped and linked
- Complete dependency graph established
- Spec.md now documents all architectural nodes
- Bidirectional relationships verified

**System Health Improvement:**
- Sync Accuracy: 100/100 (all nodes)
- Dependency Integrity: 100/100 (all nodes)
- Validation status: HEALTHY (from WARNING)
- Orphan count: 0 (from 13)
- Missing references: 0 (from 5)

**Remaining Improvements Needed:**
- Update Freshness: 50/100 (requires last_updated in node headers)
- Coverage Evidence: 0/100 (requires coverage metrics in nodes)
- Agent Relevance: varies (requires agent lists in nodes)

### 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Bidirectional Relationships**: Essential for graph coherence validation
2. **Centralized Documentation**: spec.md serves as single source of truth
3. **Metadata Standardization**: Consistent metadata enables automated scoring
4. **Continuous Validation**: Real-time drift detection prevents degradation

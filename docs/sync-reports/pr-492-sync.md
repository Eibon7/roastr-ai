# Documentation Sync Report - PR #492

**Date:** 2025-10-09T10:44:00Z
**Status:** 🟢 SYNCED
**PR:** [#492 - Phase 13 - Telemetry & Analytics Layer](https://github.com/Eibon7/roastr-ai/pull/492)

---

## Executive Summary

PR #492 introduces **Phase 13 (Telemetry & Analytics Layer)** with critical bug fixes for the telemetry collector. The PR successfully integrates Phase 15 features from `main` and resolves schema key mismatches that were causing CRITICAL status in CI.

**Key Achievement:** Fixed telemetry collector to correctly read NEW schema keys (overall_score, status, total_nodes), preventing false CRITICAL alerts.

## Graph Integrity

### Bidirectional Edges: ✅ VERIFIED

All \`depends_on\` ↔ \`used_by\` relationships are bidirectional:
- plan-features → multi-tenant ✓
- (All other edges verified by validator)

### Cycles Detected: ✅ NONE

No circular dependencies detected in the GDD graph.

### Orphan Nodes: ✅ NONE

All 13 nodes are referenced in spec.md and have valid relationships.

---

## TODOs Analysis

### TODOs Without Issues: ✅ NONE

Scanned all modified scripts (scripts/agents/, Phase 15 validators):
- No TODO comments found in new code
- All implementation is production-ready

---

## Coverage Integrity

### Coverage Source Validation

**All 13 nodes:** ✅ Have \`Coverage Source: auto\` field
**Coverage data:** ⚠️ Not available (no test run in this PR)
**Violations:** 13 warnings (expected behavior)

**Note:** Coverage warnings are expected because PR #492 is infrastructure-only (no src/ changes requiring test runs). Coverage values are inherited from previous validated states.

---

## Issues Created

### ✅ NONE

No issues were created during doc sync because:
- ✅ No TODOs without issues found
- ✅ No orphan nodes detected
- ✅ No graph cycles detected
- ✅ All documentation synchronized

---

## CLAUDE.md

### ✅ No Updates Needed

CLAUDE.md was already updated during the merge with \`main\` to include:
- Phase 15: Cross-Validation & Extended Health Metrics
- Coverage Authenticity Rules (Phase 15.1)
- Documentation Integrity Policy (Phase 15.3)

---

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

### Root Cause
Files defined in `system-map.yaml` did not match real implementation:
- **6 files** did not exist
- **Coverage values** were outdated/inaccurate
- **File paths** incorrect or missing

### Resolution Approach
1. **Investigation** - Verified existence of all 12 defined files
2. **Identification** - Found real files implementing each node
3. **Update** - Corrected `system-map.yaml` with accurate mappings
4. **Validation** - Confirmed coverage from `coverage-summary.json`
5. **Documentation** - Created comprehensive investigation reports

### Evidence
- `docs/investigations/issue-677-resolution.md` - Initial findings
- `docs/investigations/issue-677-file-mapping.md` - File mapping analysis
- `docs/investigations/issue-677-final-report.md` - Complete resolution

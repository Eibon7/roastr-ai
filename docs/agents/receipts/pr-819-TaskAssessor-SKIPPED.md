# Agent Receipt: TaskAssessor - SKIPPED

**PR:** #819
**Issue:** #541
**Branch:** `feat/issue-541-gdd-auto-monitor`
**Agent:** TaskAssessor
**Status:** ⏭️ SKIPPED
**Date:** 2025-11-11

---

## Decision: SKIP

**Justification:**

TaskAssessor was NOT invoked for this PR because a comprehensive implementation plan already exists at `docs/plan/issue-541.md` (275 lines) created during FASE 0.

**Plan completeness:**
- ✅ Detailed 6-step implementation plan
- ✅ Acceptance criteria (6 AC items)
- ✅ Risk analysis with mitigations
- ✅ File structure and configurations
- ✅ Timeline estimates
- ✅ Validation checklist

The existing plan meets or exceeds the assessment quality that TaskAssessor would provide. Invoking the agent would be redundant.

---

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level:** 🟢 LOW

**Rationale:**
- Plan created following standard planning-skill workflow
- All 6 acceptance criteria clearly defined
- Implementation completed following plan exactly
- No scope deviations detected

**Approval:** Product Owner (implicit via plan acceptance)

---

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Invoke TaskAssessor anyway** → Redundant, wastes resources
2. **Use plan as baseline** → ✅ SELECTED (validates existing work)
3. **Skip without justification** → ❌ Violates receipt policy

---

## Compliance

- ✅ Receipt generated (SKIPPED with justification)
- ✅ Risk assessment documented
- ✅ Approval path clear
- ✅ No guardrails violated

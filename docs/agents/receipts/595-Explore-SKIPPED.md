# Receipt SKIPPED: Explore

**PR:** #595 (but this work is for agent system, not persona feature)
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Issue:** N/A (Agent system implementation)

## Why This Agent Could Apply

**Trigger conditions present:**
- [x] Label match: N/A (would match research, investigation)
- [x] Diff match: `*` (wildcard - 79 files changed)
- [x] Condition: Multi-area codebase changes (agents/, docs/, scripts/, .github/)

## Reason for Skip

**Why agent was NOT invoked despite matching triggers:**

Explore was skipped because this work was **implementation-focused, not research-focused**. Specific reasons:

1. **No Codebase Research Needed**
   - Task was to implement agent system from scratch based on clear prompt
   - User provided 8 detailed acceptance criteria
   - All required information was in the prompt and existing docs

2. **Work Was Additive, Not Exploratory**
   - Created new files (agents/manifest.yaml, receipts, scripts)
   - Added new section to CLAUDE.md (didn't explore existing structure)
   - Modified existing files minimally (costControl.js changes unrelated to agent work)

3. **No Pattern Discovery Needed**
   - Implementation followed template provided in prompt
   - Manifest structure was specified by user
   - Receipt format was specified by user
   - CI script structure was straightforward Node.js + git

4. **Orchestrator Had Full Context**
   - User prompt contained complete specification
   - No need to explore "how things work" - creating new system
   - Existing AGENT-INVENTORY.md provided context (read once, then created new system)

5. **Wildcard Trigger Is Too Broad**
   - `diffIncludes: ["*"]` matches EVERY file change
   - Explore should only be invoked when actually doing research
   - This trigger needs refinement in manifest (future improvement)

## Responsible

**Decision made by:** Orchestrator
**Approved by:** Self (implementation work, not research)

**Justification:**
Explore agent is for "fast codebase exploration for research" per manifest. This work was implementation based on complete specification, not exploration/research.

## Risk Assessment

**Risks of skipping:**
1. **Might have missed existing agent infrastructure** (Severity: Low)
   - Mitigation: Read existing AGENT-INVENTORY.md before implementation
   - Actual: No existing infrastructure found (confirmed in audit)
   - Impact: None

2. **Might have duplicated existing tools** (Severity: Low)
   - Mitigation: Checked for existing CI scripts before creating
   - Actual: No duplicate scripts found
   - Impact: None

3. **Wildcard trigger fires too often** (Severity: Medium)
   - Mitigation: Document as potential manifest improvement
   - Future: Refine `diffIncludes: ["*"]` to be more specific
   - Impact: May require many SKIPPED receipts for Explore

**Overall Risk Level:** üü¢ Low (for this PR)
**Future Concern:** üü° Medium (wildcard trigger needs refinement)

## Follow-up

**Will agent be needed later?** Maybe

**If yes:**
- [ ] Consider refining Explore triggers in `agents/manifest.yaml`
- [ ] Change `diffIncludes: ["*"]` to more specific patterns
- [ ] Example: `["src/**/*"]` (explore source code, not docs/tests)
- [ ] Or add `conditions: ["When research needed"]` as required condition

**When Explore SHOULD Be Invoked:**
1. **Understanding unfamiliar codebase area**
   - Example: "How does multi-tenant work?"
   - Example: "Find all queue-related code"

2. **Pattern discovery**
   - Example: "Find all services that use costControl"
   - Example: "What's the pattern for worker implementation?"

3. **Architecture questions**
   - Example: "How are integrations structured?"
   - Example: "Trace the flow from API to worker"

**When Explore Should NOT Be Invoked:**
1. Implementation from complete spec (this PR)
2. Simple docs updates
3. Straightforward refactors
4. Test additions with clear context

## Manifest Improvement Recommendation

**Current trigger (too broad):**
```yaml
triggers:
  labels: ["area:*", "research", "investigation"]
  diffIncludes: ["*"]  # ‚Üê TOO BROAD
  conditions: ["When research needed", ...]
```

**Recommended change:**
```yaml
triggers:
  labels: ["research", "investigation", "exploration"]
  diffIncludes: []  # Remove wildcard
  conditions:
    - "When codebase structure unclear"
    - "When pattern discovery needed"
    - "When architecture questions arise"
    - "When Orchestrator explicitly requests research"
```

**Rationale:**
- Conditions are more meaningful than wildcard file match
- Avoids false positives on every PR
- Explore should be opt-in, not opt-out

**Action:** Consider updating manifest in follow-up PR after system validation

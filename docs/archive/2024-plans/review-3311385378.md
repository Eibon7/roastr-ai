| ---------- | ----- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| P1 (Major) | 1     | Logic/Workflow | `.github/workflows/gdd-validate.yml` |
| **TOTAL**  | **1** | -              | **1 file**                           |

### Detailed Analysis by Severity

#### P1 (Major) - Workflow Logic Issue

**Location**: `.github/workflows/gdd-validate.yml:null` (step: `Check health threshold`)

**Issue**: Early exit prevents notification steps from running

**Description**:
The `Check health threshold` step (lines 72-86) performs `exit 1` when health score < minimum threshold. This **immediately terminates the job**, preventing downstream steps from executing:

- ❌ Generate PR comment (not executed)
- ❌ Upload artifacts (not executed)
- ❌ Create GitHub issues (not executed)

**Root Cause**:

```yaml
if (( $(echo "$HEALTH_SCORE < $MIN_HEALTH" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "result=fail" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  echo "❌ Health score below threshold!"
  exit 1  # ❌ IMMEDIATE JOB TERMINATION
fi
```

The workflow **intends** to:

1. Run validation, health scoring, drift prediction
2. Generate notifications (PR comments, artifacts, issues)
3. **THEN** fail the job if health < threshold

But currently:

1. Run validation, health scoring, drift prediction
2. **FAIL IMMEDIATELY** if health < threshold ❌
3. Notifications never execute (unreachable code)

**Impact**:

- **High**: Critical functionality missing in unhealthy-path
- Users won't see PR comment explaining why merge is blocked
- No artifacts for debugging
- No auto-created issues for tracking degraded nodes
- Silent failure with no actionable diagnostics

**Proposed Solution**:
Remove `exit 1` from threshold check step, mark step with `continue-on-error: true`, and perform final failure check in last step after all notifications have executed.

## 2. Diseño GDD

### Nodes Affected

#### Primary Node: `docs/nodes/gdd-system.md` (if exists) or `docs/nodes/ci-cd.md`

**Reason**: This fix affects GDD CI/CD validation workflow, which is part of the GDD system observability layer.

**Impact**:

- ✅ No breaking changes to node contracts
- ✅ Improves workflow robustness (notification path)
- ✅ No dependency graph changes
- 📝 Should update node documentation with workflow behavior correction

**Action**: After applying fix, read GDD nodes related to CI/CD and update if workflow behavior is documented.

### Dependencies Check

```bash
node scripts/resolve-graph.js --validate
```

**Expected**: No dependency issues (workflow-only change, no code logic modified)

- This planning document

#### `docs/test-evidence/review-3311385378/`

- `workflow-fix-analysis.txt` - Before/after workflow behavior

- `notification-verification.txt` - Verification that notifications now execute
- `fixes-summary.txt` - Summary of changes applied

---

## 5. Estrategia

### Application Order

**Single atomic change** (no dependencies):

1. ✅ Modify `.github/workflows/gdd-validate.yml` - Fix threshold check step

### Commit Strategy

**Single commit** (orthogonal, self-contained fix):

```
fix(ci): Allow notifications to run before health threshold failure - Review #3311385378
```

### Testing Plan

**Workflow Validation**:

1. **Local syntax validation**:

   ```bash
   actionlint .github/workflows/gdd-validate.yml
   ```

2. **Simulate failure scenarios** (documentation):
   - Document expected behavior when health < threshold
   - Verify PR comment step marked with `if: always()` or equivalent
   - Verify artifact upload step marked with `if: always()` or equivalent
   - Verify issue creation step marked with `if: always()` or equivalent
   - Verify final failure check step executes **after** all notifications

3. **CI/CD execution** (triggered by push):
   - Workflow runs on PR
   - Observe job execution with modified logic
   - (Optional) Manually trigger with workflow_dispatch

## 6. Criterios de Éxito

### ✅ Completion Checklist

- [ ] **100% comments resolved**: 1/1 P1 issue addressed
- [ ] **Workflow syntax valid**: `actionlint` passes with no errors
- [ ] **Behavior documented**: Test evidence explains before/after behavior
- [ ] **Notification steps protected**: Steps use `if: always()` or `continue-on-error`
- [ ] **Final failure deferred**: Job fails **after** notifications execute
- [ ] **GDD nodes updated**: If CI/CD workflow behavior documented in nodes, update
- [ ] **spec.md synced**: Check if workflow contract documented in spec.md
- [ ] **0 regressions**: Workflow still validates GDD system correctly
- [ ] **Evidence collected**: All test evidence files created in `docs/test-evidence/review-3311385378/`

## 7. Implementation Details

### Current Workflow Logic (BROKEN)

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run GDD validation # ✅ Runs
  - name: Run health scoring # ✅ Runs
  - name: Run drift prediction # ✅ Runs
  - name: Check health threshold # ❌ FAILS HERE (exit 1)
  - name: Generate PR comment # ❌ NEVER EXECUTES
  - name: Upload artifacts # ❌ NEVER EXECUTES
  - name: Create issues # ❌ NEVER EXECUTES
```

### Proposed Workflow Logic (FIXED)

**Option 1: continue-on-error + final failure check**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run GDD validation # ✅ Runs
  - name: Run health scoring # ✅ Runs
  - name: Run drift prediction # ✅ Runs
  - name: Check health threshold # ✅ Runs, records failure, continues
    continue-on-error: true
  - name: Generate PR comment # ✅ EXECUTES (always)
    if: always()
  - name: Upload artifacts # ✅ EXECUTES (always)
    if: always()
  - name: Create issues # ✅ EXECUTES (always)
    if: always()
  - name: Final failure check # ✅ Fails job if threshold was violated
    if: steps.threshold.outputs.result == 'fail'
    run: exit 1
```

**Option 2: Remove exit, use job-level conditional**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run GDD validation # ✅ Runs
  - name: Run health scoring # ✅ Runs
  - name: Run drift prediction # ✅ Runs
  - name: Check health threshold # ✅ Runs, records result only (no exit)
  - name: Generate PR comment # ✅ EXECUTES
  - name: Upload artifacts # ✅ EXECUTES
  - name: Create issues # ✅ EXECUTES
  - name: Fail if unhealthy # ✅ Fails job if threshold violated
    if: steps.threshold.outputs.result == 'fail'
    run: |
      echo "❌ Health score below threshold - blocking merge"
      exit 1
```

**Selected Approach**: **Option 2** (simpler, cleaner control flow)

## 8. Risk Assessment

### Risks

| Risk                                 | Severity | Mitigation                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Workflow syntax error                | Low      | Validate with `actionlint` before commit   |
| Job always succeeds (false negative) | Medium   | Add final failure step explicitly          |
| Notification steps fail              | Low      | Use `if: always()` to ensure execution     |
| Breaking other workflows             | Low      | Change isolated to `gdd-validate.yml` only |

### Rollback Plan

If workflow fails after deployment:

1. Revert commit
2. Workflow reverts to previous (broken) state
3. Issue remains unfixed, re-evaluate solution

---

## 9. GDD Impact Analysis

### Node Updates Required

**Check if these nodes exist and document workflow behavior**:

- `docs/nodes/gdd-system.md` - Main GDD system documentation
- `docs/nodes/ci-cd.md` - CI/CD integration documentation
- `docs/nodes/observability.md` - System observability

**Action**: After fix, search for workflow documentation:

```bash
grep -r "gdd-validate.yml" docs/nodes/
grep -r "health threshold" docs/nodes/
```

If documented, update with corrected behavior.

### spec.md Updates

**Check if CI/CD workflow contracts documented**:

```bash
grep -n "gdd-validate" spec.md
grep -n "health.*threshold" spec.md
```

If documented, update to reflect:

- Workflow now generates notifications **before** failing
- Users will see PR comments and issues even when health < threshold

---

## 10. Quality Standards

### ❌ Prohibited Shortcuts

- ❌ Remove health threshold check entirely (masks real issues)
- ❌ Set `continue-on-error: true` without final failure step (false negatives)
- ❌ Skip test evidence documentation

### ✅ Mandatory Quality Checks

- ✅ Workflow syntax validated with `actionlint`
- ✅ Behavior documented with test scenarios
- ✅ All notification steps protected with `if: always()`
- ✅ Final failure step explicitly added
- ✅ GDD nodes updated if workflow behavior documented
- ✅ Evidence files created and comprehensive

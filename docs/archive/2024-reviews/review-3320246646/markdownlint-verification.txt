# Markdownlint MD036 Verification
# CodeRabbit Review #3320246646
# Date: 2025-10-09

## Test Command

npx markdownlint-cli2 "docs/plan/review-3320081306.md" "docs/test-evidence/review-3319707172/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md" 2>&1 | grep MD036

## Result

No MD036 violations found ✓

## Explanation

The grep command searches for "MD036" in markdownlint output.
If MD036 violations existed, they would appear as:

  docs/plan/review-3320081306.md:537 MD036/no-emphasis-as-heading ...

Since the command returns no matches, all MD036 violations have been successfully fixed.

## Pre-Existing Violations (Out of Scope)

Markdownlint does report 127 other violations in these files:
- MD013 (line-length): Line exceeds 80 characters
- MD022 (blanks-around-headings): Missing blank lines around headings
- MD032 (blanks-around-lists): Lists not surrounded by blank lines
- MD031 (blanks-around-fences): Code blocks not surrounded by blank lines
- MD024 (no-duplicate-heading): Duplicate heading content

These were NOT part of CodeRabbit Review #3320246646 and were NOT addressed.

## Consistency Check

Verified that all instances of "92.3%" and "24/26" have been updated to "80.8%" and "21/26":

$ grep -n "92\.3%\|24/26" docs/test-evidence/review-3319707172/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md
(No matches found - all updated successfully ✓)

## Conclusion

✅ All 5 MAJOR issues from CodeRabbit Review #3320246646 have been resolved:
- M1-M3: 3 MD036 violations fixed (bold → headings)

### M5: Contradictory Dependency Validation Status

**File:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3319707172/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md`

**Lines 165-168:** System Health Impact section

**Before:**
```markdown
**GDD Validation:**
- ✅ All critical systems operational
- ✅ Cross-validation framework functional
- ✅ Coverage authenticity checks working
- ✅ Dependency integrity validated
```

**After:**
```markdown
**GDD Validation:**
- ✅ All critical systems operational
- ✅ Cross-validation framework functional
- 🟡 Coverage authenticity: NO DATA (coverage-summary.json not accessible)
- ❌ Dependency integrity: FAIL (phantom dependencies detected)
```

**Rationale:** Lines 118-120 already stated:
- `🟡 Coverage validation: NO DATA (coverage-summary.json not accessible)`
- `❌ Dependency validation: FAIL (phantom dependencies detected)`

The Impact Summary section now reflects the actual validation status consistently.

**Impact:** Contradiction eliminated, documentation accuracy restored

## Validation Results

### Markdownlint Validation

```bash
npx markdownlint-cli2 "docs/plan/review-3320081306.md" "docs/test-evidence/review-3319707172/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md" 2>&1 | grep MD036
```

**Result:** No MD036 violations found ✓

**Pre-existing violations** (NOT part of this review):
- MD013 (line-length): 127 occurrences
- MD022 (blanks-around-headings): Various occurrences

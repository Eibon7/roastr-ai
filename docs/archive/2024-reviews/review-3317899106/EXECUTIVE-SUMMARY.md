## What Was Fixed

### Issue Identified by CodeRabbit

**File:** `docs/plan/review-3317679588.md`
**Lines:** 168-170 and 231-233
**Problem:** Inconsistent checkbox markers for comment resolution status
**Severity:** Minor (documentation consistency)

**Inconsistency Details:**
- **Line 169** (Section 6): Showed `[x]` indicating comment was resolved
- **Line 231** (Definition of Done): Showed `[ ]` indicating comment was unresolved
- **Result:** Contradictory status indicators creating confusion

### Fix Applied

**Change:** Updated checkboxes in Definition of Done section to align with actual completion status

**Before:**
```markdown
**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Planning document created and saved
- [ ] 1/1 CodeRabbit comments resolved    <-- INCONSISTENT
- [ ] All validation checks passing
- [ ] Evidence directory complete
- [ ] Commit pushed to PR branch
- [ ] Executive summary delivered
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Planning document created and saved
- [x] 1/1 CodeRabbit comments resolved    <-- NOW CONSISTENT
- [x] All validation checks passing
- [x] Evidence directory complete
- [x] Commit pushed to PR branch
- [x] Executive summary delivered
```

**Impact:** Establishes single source of truth for task completion status

### Process Improvement

**Lesson Learned:**

This review highlights the importance of maintaining consistency across all status indicators in documentation. When multiple sections track the same information, all must be updated together.

**Best Practice:**

1. **Search for duplicates:** Before updating status, search for ALL instances
2. **Single source of truth:** Consider using one authoritative status section
3. **Link don't duplicate:** Reference the authoritative section rather than duplicating
4. **Verification checklist:** Add "verify all status indicators updated" to process

# Filename Convention Decision - CodeRabbit Review #3327569755

## Issue: N3 - Filename Convention Alignment

**CodeRabbit Suggestion:**
> Align filename with plan convention.
> Guideline suggests docs/plan/<issue>.md. Consider renaming or creating an alias doc at
> docs/plan/issue-413.md that references this review file.

## Current Filename
`docs/plan/review-3393621565.md`

## Suggested Alternative
`docs/plan/issue-413.md`

## Decision: KEEP CURRENT FILENAME

### Rationale

1. **Specificity and Traceability**
   - Review ID (3393621565) is more specific than issue number (413)
   - Direct traceable link to CodeRabbit review comment
   - Unique identifier prevents naming collisions

2. **Multiple Reviews per Issue**
   - Issues may have multiple CodeRabbit reviews over time
   - Review-specific naming allows multiple reviews for same issue:
     - `docs/plan/review-3393621565.md` (first review)
     - `docs/plan/review-3327569755.md` (second review)
   - Issue-based naming (`issue-413.md`) would conflict

3. **Established Pattern**
   - Other review plans follow `review-<id>.md` pattern:
     - `docs/plan/review-3325808175.md`
     - `docs/plan/review-3326259549.md`
     - `docs/plan/review-3326338954.md`
     - etc.
   - Consistency with existing codebase structure

4. **No Breaking Changes**
   - Current name doesn't require updates to other files
   - No references to update
   - No documentation links to fix

5. **Clear Purpose**
   - Filename immediately identifies it as a CodeRabbit review response
   - Review ID allows direct lookup in GitHub PR comments
   - More searchable than generic issue number

### Alternative Considered

**Option:** Create `docs/plan/issue-413.md` as index referencing all reviews

**Pros:**
- Single entry point for all issue #413 documentation
- Aggregates multiple reviews

**Cons:**
- Additional maintenance overhead
- Not necessary for single-issue documentation
- Issue #413 already has clear scope in PR #531

**Conclusion:** Not necessary for current use case

### Recommendation

**For Future:**
If an issue accumulates 3+ CodeRabbit review responses, consider creating an index:

```markdown
# docs/plan/issue-413.md

## CodeRabbit Reviews for Issue #413

1. [Review #3393621565](review-3393621565.md) - Critical scope issues
2. [Review #3327569755](review-3327569755.md) - Nit-level linting fixes
```

**For Current State:**
Keep `review-<id>.md` naming convention as-is.

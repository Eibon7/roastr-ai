CodeRabbit Review #3310592588 - Fix Summary
============================================

Issue: Empty branch push on manual dispatch
Severity: Major
File: .github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml
Lines: 112-114 → 112-118 (+4 lines)

ROOT CAUSE
----------
- github.head_ref is only populated during pull_request events
- workflow_dispatch runs have github.head_ref = "" (empty string)
- Original code: TARGET_BRANCH="${{ github.head_ref }}"
- Result: git push origin HEAD:"" (malformed command, push fails)

FIX APPLIED
-----------
1. Added fallback to github.ref_name:
   TARGET_BRANCH="${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}"

2. Added guard for empty branch:
   if [ -z "$TARGET_BRANCH" ]; then
     echo "❌ Cannot determine target branch for push"
     exit 1
   fi

3. Maintained original push logic:
   git push origin HEAD:"$TARGET_BRANCH"

BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
-----------------
| Scenario | github.head_ref | github.ref_name | TARGET_BRANCH | Result |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|---------|
| PR event | feat/my-branch | refs/pull/123/merge | feat/my-branch | ✅ Push to PR branch |
| workflow_dispatch (branch) | "" (empty) | main | main | ✅ Push to main |
| workflow_dispatch (tag) | "" (empty) | v1.0.0 | v1.0.0 | ✅ Push to tag |
| Unknown context | "" (empty) | "" (empty) | "" (empty) | ❌ Fail gracefully |

TESTING
-------
✅ Workflow YAML syntax validated
✅ GitHub Actions expression syntax correct
✅ Bash conditional guard working
✅ Error message clear and actionable
✅ Exit code 1 on failure (CI/CD observable)

IMPACT
------
✅ Fixes core Phase 12 manual workflow scenario (workflow_dispatch)
✅ Maintains backward compatibility (PR events)
✅ Graceful error handling (empty branch case)
✅ Production-ready code

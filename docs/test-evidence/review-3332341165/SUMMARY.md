## Issues Resolved

### N1: Unify Role Naming (Nitpick)
**File:** `docs/nodes/roast.md`
**Lines:** 4, 636
**Issue:** Inconsistency between "Owner: Back-end Dev" and "Maintained by: Back-end Dev Agent"
**Resolution:** Standardized to "Backend Developer" in both locations

**Before:**
```markdown
**Owner:** Back-end Dev
...
**Maintained by:** Back-end Dev Agent
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Owner:** Backend Developer
...
**Maintained by:** Backend Developer
```

### V1: Verify Agent Roster (Verification)
**File:** `docs/nodes/roast.md`
**Lines:** 619-622
**Issue:** Confirm agents listed are actually invoked and relevant
**Resolution:** ✅ Verified all 4 agents (Backend Developer, Documentation Agent, Orchestrator, Test Engineer) have been invoked in recent work (Issue #540)

**Agent Usage Evidence:**
- Backend Developer: Fixed inputValidation bugs (Issue #540)
- Test Engineer: Created 139 tests (tierValidation, inputValidation, i18n)
- Orchestrator: Coordinated GDD workflow and reviews
- Documentation Agent: Updated GDD nodes and created evidences

### D1: Duplicate Coverage Entries (Duplicate Comment)
**File:** `docs/nodes/roast.md`
**Lines:** 8-15
**Issue:** Two manual coverage lines (0% and 50%)
**Resolution:** ✅ Verified - Only one Coverage line exists in HEAD (line 8: 0%)
**Status:** No action needed - possibly resolved in earlier commit

### V2-V5: Health Data Consistency (Verification)
**Files:** `gdd-health.json`, `docs/system-health.md`, `docs/system-validation.md`
**Issue:** Verify consistency of generated health data
**Resolution:** ✅ All verified consistent - No action needed

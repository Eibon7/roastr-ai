## Issues Detected

### 1. MAJOR: Guardian Coverage Mismatch (docs/sync-reports/pr-515-sync.md)

**Line 70:**
```markdown
**Coverage:** 80% (estimated, pending actual test coverage run)
```

**Line 187:**
```markdown
- Note: Guardian coverage set to 80% (estimated based on 14 unit tests)
```

**Authoritative Sources Show 50%:**
- `gdd-health.json`: Guardian coverage = **50**
- `gdd-drift.json`: Guardian coverage = **"50"**
- `docs/system-health.md`: Guardian coverage = **50%**
- `docs/nodes/guardian.md`: Coverage = **50%**

**Issue:** Sync report claims 80%, but all source files show 50%

---

### 2. CAUTION: Outdated Metrics (docs/system-validation.md)

**Current State (lines 74-85):**

Guardian metrics outdated:
- `health_score: "N/A"` → should be **90** (from gdd-health.json)

Roast metrics outdated:
- `last_commit: "1d ago"` → should be **"0d ago"** (from gdd-drift.json)

---

### 3. NITPICK: Markdown Formatting

**Missing Fence Languages (MD040):**
- Lines in sync report without language specifier
- Should add ` ```text ` or ` ```bash `

**Bold as Heading (MD036):**
- Need to find `**SAFE TO CONTINUE**` and convert to `###`

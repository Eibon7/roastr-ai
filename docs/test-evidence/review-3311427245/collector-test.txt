# Telemetry Collector Test - Review #3311427245

## Test Command
```bash
node scripts/collect-gdd-telemetry.js --ci
```

## Test Results

### Console Output
```
⚠️ auto-repair-report.md not found
✅ Snapshot saved to /Users/emiliopostigo/roastr-ai/telemetry/snapshots/gdd-metrics-history.json
✅ Report generated: /Users/emiliopostigo/roastr-ai/telemetry/reports/gdd-telemetry-2025-10-07.md
```

**Exit Code:** 0 ✅

### Health Metrics (Before C3 Fix)
```json
{
  "overall_score": 0,           ← ❌ WRONG (should be 95.5)
  "total_nodes": 0,             ← ❌ WRONG (should be 13)
  "status": "unknown"           ← ❌ WRONG (should be "healthy")
}
```

**Issues:**
- Schema mismatch between `gdd-health.json` and collector
- `gdd-health.json` uses: `node_count`, `average_score`, `overall_status`
- Collector expected: `total_nodes`, `overall_score`, `status`

### Health Metrics (After C3 Fix)
```json
{
  "overall_score": 95.5,        ← ✅ CORRECT (mapped from average_score)
  "average_score": 95.5,        ← ✅ CORRECT (direct read)
  "healthy_count": 13,          ← ✅ CORRECT
  "degraded_count": 0,          ← ✅ CORRECT
  "critical_count": 0,          ← ✅ CORRECT
  "total_nodes": 13,            ← ✅ CORRECT (mapped from node_count)
  "status": "healthy"           ← ✅ CORRECT (mapped from overall_status)
}
```

**Result:** ✅ ALL METRICS CORRECT

## Validation Status

✅ **C3 FIX VALIDATED**

**Issues Resolved:**
- Schema mapping implemented correctly
- Fallback handling for both old/new schemas
- Case normalization for status field
- All health metrics now captured accurately

**Test Environment:**
- Node.js: v18
- OS: macOS
- Date: 2025-10-07

**Artifacts:**
- ✅ telemetry/snapshots/gdd-metrics-history.json (updated)
- ✅ telemetry/reports/gdd-telemetry-2025-10-07.md (generated)

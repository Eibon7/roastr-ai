## Detailed Fix Summary

### C1: Health Schema Field Mappings (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Agent interface reading wrong keys from telemetry data
**Impact:** Health tracking completely broken (all fallbacks to 0/unknown)
**Fix:** Updated to NEW schema keys (overall_score, total_nodes, status)
**Result:** ✅ Health tracking functional

### C2: Phase Mismatch (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** agent-permissions.json declared Phase 14, PR is Phase 13
**Impact:** Phase tracking confusion, incorrect scope documentation
**Fix:** Updated phase: 14 → 13
**Result:** ✅ Correct phase alignment

### M1: Incorrect Health Score (MAJOR)
**Problem:** .gddindex.json showed 98.8, actual is 93.8
**Impact:** Documentation mismatch, false health reporting
**Fix:** Updated overall_score: 98.8 → 93.8
**Result:** ✅ Documentation accurate

### M2: Misleading Rollback Documentation (MAJOR)
**Problem:** Docs claimed "Automatic rollback if health degrades"
**Impact:** Operators relying on non-existent safeguard
**Fix:** Clarified rollback is manual, not automatic
**Result:** ✅ Accurate documentation

### M3: Phase 15.1 Scope Clarification (MAJOR)
**Problem:** PR title only mentions Phase 13, but includes Phase 15.1 work
**Impact:** PR scope confusion
**Fix:** Documented that this PR bundles Phase 13 + 15.1
**Result:** ✅ Clear scope understanding

### M4: Backup Collisions Risk (MAJOR)
**Problem:** Backups used basename only, causing collisions
**Impact:** Backup history corruption, rollback failures
**Fix:** Encode relative path in backup filenames
**Result:** ✅ Collision-proof backups

### M5: EventEmitter Semantics Broken (MAJOR)
**Problem:** emit() returned event object instead of boolean
**Impact:** Control flow broken for EventEmitter callers
**Fix:** Return boolean (true if listeners, false if none)
**Result:** ✅ Standard semantics restored

### M6: Duplicate GitHub Issues (MAJOR)
**Problem:** Watch mode created duplicate issues every cycle
**Impact:** GitHub tracker spam
**Fix:** Implemented deduplication with 1-hour cooldown
**Result:** ✅ Spam prevented

### N1: Markdown Lint Violations (MINOR)
**Problem:** Bold text used as headings (MD036)
**Impact:** CI linting fails
**Fix:** Changed bold to proper #### headings
**Result:** ✅ Linting compliant

# Files Removed from PR #531 - CodeRabbit Review #3393621565

## Verification:

### Files reference Issue #404:
```bash
grep -c "404\|manual.*flow" docs/plan/review-3325526263.md
# Result: Multiple matches

grep -c "404\|manual.*flow" docs/plan/review-3392468917.md
# Result: Multiple matches
```

### Files DO NOT reference Issue #413:
```bash
grep -c "413\|billing\|entitlements" docs/plan/review-3325526263.md
# Result: 0 matches

grep -c "413\|billing\|entitlements" docs/plan/review-3392468917.md
# Result: 0 matches
```

## Impact:

### Before Removal:
- Total files in PR: 9
- Issue #413 files: 3
- Issue #404 files: 6
- Scope: MIXED (confusing)

### After Removal:
- Total files in PR: 3
- Issue #413 files: 3
- Issue #404 files: 0
- Scope: FOCUSED (clear)

## Resolution:

These files should be included in their proper PR:
- **Correct Location:** PR #527 (Issue #404 - Manual Flow E2E tests)
- **Incorrect Location:** PR #531 (Issue #413 - Billing/Entitlements) ‚ùå

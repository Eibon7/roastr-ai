---

## Issues Resolved

### P1-1: Document references non-existent E2E npm scripts (Lines 69-73)

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - No fix needed, scripts exist

**Analysis:**
- **CodeRabbit Concern:** Documentation mentioned `npm run test:e2e*` scripts that might not exist
- **Investigation:** Checked `package.json` lines 113-116
- **Finding:** ALL E2E scripts exist and are functional:
  ```json
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
  "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
  "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug"
  ```
- **Resolution:** Documentation is accurate. Scripts were added after PR was created but before review.
- **Evidence:** `package.json` lines 113-116
- **Impact:** Positive - Users can follow docs and commands will work

### P1-2: Demo fixture commands do not exist (Lines 196-202)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED - Added clear "NOT YET IMPLEMENTED" warning

**Problem:**
- Documentation described demo fixture system (`data/fixtures/`, `npm run demo:*` scripts)
- Reality: Neither directory nor scripts exist
- Risk: Users would encounter "command not found" errors

**Root Cause:**
- Testing guide was aspirational, documenting planned Issue #420 features
- Feature not yet implemented

**Solution Applied:**
Added clear status warning at section start:

```markdown
> ⚠️ **Status:** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED - The demo fixture system described below is planned but not yet available. The `data/fixtures/` directory and npm scripts do not exist yet. Refer to Backend Integration Fixtures (below) for currently available fixture functionality.
```

**Changes Made:**
1. Added warning box at docs/TESTING-GUIDE.md:440
2. Changed "Location" → "Planned Location"
3. Changed "Commands" → "Planned Commands"
4. Changed "What gets seeded" → "Planned Data"
5. Changed "Demo credentials" → "Planned Demo Credentials"
6. Changed "When to use" → "Intended Use Cases"
7. Updated documentation reference: "Will be available at data/fixtures/README.md when implemented"
8. Commented out demo commands in Quick Reference section (lines 797-798)

**Verification:**
```bash
$ ls -la data/fixtures/
❌ data/fixtures/ directory not found

$ grep -E '"demo:' package.json
(no output - scripts don't exist)
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Users won't be confused or encounter errors
- ✅ Preserved planned feature documentation for future reference
- ✅ Clear guidance to use Backend Integration Fixtures instead

### Minor-1: Add language hint to code block (Lines 389-395)

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

**Problem:**
Fenced code block showing test output lacked language identifier for proper syntax highlighting:

```markdown
```
Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
...
```
```

**Solution:**
Added `text` language identifier:

```markdown
```text
Test Suites: 5 passed, 5 total
...
```
```

**File:** docs/TESTING-GUIDE.md:637
**Impact:** Improved readability, proper syntax highlighting

## Merge Conflict Resolution

### docs/TESTING-GUIDE.md (Add/Add Conflict)

**Conflict:**
- Branch `feat/issue-421-testing-guide`: Created comprehensive testing guide (563 lines)
- Branch `main`: Also added testing guide with "MVP Flow Validations" section (250 lines)

**Resolution Strategy:**
Kept BOTH versions by:
1. Preserving PR's comprehensive structure and organization
2. Integrating main's valuable "MVP Flow Validations (October 2025)" section
3. Inserted MVP section after "Specialized Test Suites" and before "Environment Variables"

**Result:**
- ✅ No content lost from either branch
- ✅ Logical flow maintained
- ✅ Enhanced documentation with MVP validations

**Conflict Markers Removed:**
- Line 109: `<<<<<<< HEAD`
- Line 110: `=======`
- Line 270: `>>>>>>> main`

## Validation & Testing

### Documentation Accuracy Verification

**E2E Scripts:**
```bash
$ grep -E '"test:e2e' package.json
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
    "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
    "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug"
```
✅ All scripts exist and match documentation

**Demo Scripts:**
```bash
$ grep -E '"demo:' package.json
(no output)
```
✅ No scripts exist, documentation now accurately reflects this

**Fixtures Directory:**
```bash
$ ls -la data/fixtures/
❌ data/fixtures/ directory not found
```
✅ Directory doesn't exist, documentation now warns about this

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Verification First:** Checked package.json before assuming P1-1 was valid
2. **Preserve Intent:** Kept planned features with clear status instead of removing
3. **User-Centric:** Added alternative guidance (Backend Integration Fixtures)
4. **Merge Strategy:** Integrated both branches without losing content

### Documentation Patterns to Follow

1. **Status Indicators:** Use `> ⚠️ **Status:** NOT YET IMPLEMENTED` for planned features
2. **Language Tags:** Always add language hints to code blocks (```bash, ```text, ```json)
3. **Alternative Guidance:** When feature unavailable, point to working alternatives
4. **Label Prefixing:** Use "Planned X" for aspirational documentation

### CodeRabbit Feedback Integration

- ✅ All 3 comments addressed
- ✅ Documentation now passes accuracy checks
- ✅ No follow-up issues expected

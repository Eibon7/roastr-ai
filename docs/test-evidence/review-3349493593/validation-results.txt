âœ… CORE FIXES VERIFIED - Template Normalization Complete

**Review:** #3349493593
**Applied Fixes:** C2, C3, m3 (template root cause)
**Status:** 100% of applicable fixes completed

**Context:**
Review #3349493593 identified 6 issues, but 3 of them (C1, m1, m2) referenced
files from review #3349006632 that no longer exist on this branch (likely
rebased away). The core template bugs (C2, C3, m3) have been fully fixed.

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js** (5 fixes):
   - Line 175: Added parseInt radix to git timestamp parsing
   - Line 316: Added parseInt radix to coverage parsing
   - Lines 393-402: Normalized status to lowercase in getDriftEmoji()
   - Lines 408-414: Normalized status to uppercase in calculateOverallStats()
   - Result: Case-insensitive status handling throughout

2. **Auto-Generated Files** (regenerated with fixed template):
   - gdd-drift.json: healthy_count now 15 (was 14), all emojis ðŸŸ¢
   - docs/drift-report.md: Correct counts and emojis
   - docs/system-validation.md: Updated drift summary
   - gdd-status.json: Refreshed validation snapshot

**Validation Results:**
âœ… JSON syntax: valid
âœ… healthy_count: 15 (was 14) - now includes observability node
âœ… All nodes: status "healthy" with correct ðŸŸ¢ emojis
âœ… at_risk_count: 0 âœ…
âœ… high_risk_count: 0 âœ…
âœ… 15 nodes validated (15/15) âœ…

**Root Cause Resolved:**
Previous review (#3349006632) changed getDriftStatus() to return uppercase
status values, but forgot to update downstream consumers. This fix adds
normalization so the system is case-insensitive and won't break again.

**Evidence Files Referenced but Not Found:**
- docs/test-evidence/review-3349006632/health-check.txt
- docs/test-evidence/review-3349006632/m1-pii-logging-security-note.txt
- docs/test-evidence/review-3349006632/SUMMARY.md

These files existed in commit 861d9082 but were removed/rebased away
before this fix was applied.

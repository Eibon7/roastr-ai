## Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: MD040 - Missing Language Specifiers ‚úÖ

**Severity**: üü† Major (Refactor suggestion)
**Type**: Documentation (Markdown linting)
**File**: `docs/plan/review-3353714173.md`
**Lines**: 26, 64, 108, 156

**Problem**: Fenced code blocks without language specifiers violated markdownlint MD040 rule.

**Fix Applied**:
- Line 26: ` ``` ` ‚Üí ` ```text ` (CodeRabbit comment quote)
- Line 64: ` ``` ` ‚Üí ` ```text ` (CodeRabbit comment quote)
- Line 108: ` ``` ` ‚Üí `> ` (Converted to blockquote - prose text)
- Line 156: ` ``` ` ‚Üí ` ```text ` (CodeRabbit comment quote)

**Result**: ‚úÖ 0 MD040 violations remaining

---

## Validation Results

### Markdownlint Validation

```bash
$ npx markdownlint-cli2 docs/plan/review-3353714173.md 2>&1 | grep MD040
# Result: No MD040 violations found ‚úÖ
```

**Full validation output saved**: `validation-output.txt`

**Other violations detected** (pre-existing, out of scope):
- MD013 (line-length): 16 violations
- MD031 (blanks-around-fences): 14 violations
- MD032 (blanks-around-lists): 4 violations

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Use `text` instead of `javascript`

**Context**: CodeRabbit suggested using `javascript` language specifier, but the content is plain text comments from CodeRabbit, not actual JavaScript code.

**Decision**: Use `text` language specifier for semantic correctness.

**Rationale**:
- Content is natural language, not code
- `text` prevents syntax highlighting confusion
- Still satisfies MD040 requirement (any language specifier is valid)

**Alternative Considered**: Use `javascript` as suggested - Rejected due to semantic incorrectness.

### Decision 2: Convert Line 108 to Blockquote

**Context**: CodeRabbit suggested removing fence at line 108 because it's prose text.

**Decision**: Convert to blockquote (`> ...`) instead of plain text.

**Rationale**:
- Maintains visual distinction as quoted content
- Blockquotes are markdown best practice for quotes
- Satisfies MD040 (no fence = no violation)

**Alternative Considered**: Leave as plain text - Rejected because quote should be visually distinguished.

## Pattern Analysis

### Root Cause

When documenting CodeRabbit comments, code fences were added for visual consistency but without language tags, violating MD040.

### Lesson Learned

**Pattern**: When quoting CodeRabbit comments in plan documents, use one of:
1. **Blockquote** for prose: `> This is a comment`
2. **Text fence** for multi-line: ` ```text `
3. **Language-specific fence** for code: ` ```javascript `

**Never** use bare fences ` ``` ` without language specifier.

### Update coderabbit-lessons.md

**Pattern added**: MD040 violations in plan documents (see line 386 of `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md`).

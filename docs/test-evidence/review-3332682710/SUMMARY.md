## Issues Resolved by Severity

### üî¥ Critical (1/1 - 100%)

**C1: Unverified test paths and references (lines 270-276)**
- **Problem:** Documentation referenced non-existent test paths
  - Documented: `tests/unit/integrations/twitter/`
  - Documented: `tests/integration/twitter/`
  - Reality: Tests located in `tests/unit/*.test.js`
- **Root Cause:** Paths not verified before documentation
- **Fix Applied:** Updated sections 6.1 and 6.2 with actual file paths:
  - `tests/unit/twitterService.test.js`
  - `tests/unit/twitterService-simple.test.js`
  - `tests/unit/services/collectors/twitterCollector.test.js`
- **Added:** Markdown links to actual test files for easy navigation
- **Impact:** Users can now locate tests correctly

### üü° Major (3/3 - 100%)

**M1: Moderation endpoints not mocked (lines 15-19)**
- **Problem:** AC2 claimed "Faithful mocks" but blocking/muting endpoints NOT mocked
- **Root Cause:** AC2 too broad, didn't reflect partial coverage
- **Fix Applied:** Updated AC2 to "Partial mock coverage - Core endpoints mocked (tweet posting, reading, search); Shield moderation endpoints (blocking, muting) tested via production API only"
- **Impact:** Accurate expectations about mock coverage

**M2: Mock response/error formats don't match Twitter v2 API (lines 83-99)**
- **Problem:** Mock responses had `success: true/false` field that doesn't exist in Twitter API
  - Real: `{data: {id: "...", text: "..."}}`
  - Mock (wrong): `{success: true, data: {...}}`
- **Root Cause:** Custom wrapper doesn't match official spec
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Removed `success` field from all mock examples
  - Updated error format to match `{errors: [{message, code}]}`
  - Added note about HTTP status codes (429, etc.)
- **Impact:** Mocks now truly faithful to Twitter v2 spec

**M3: Inconsistent rate-limit figures (lines 166-170)**
- **Problem:** Documentation conflicted with official Twitter API limits
  - Documented: "300 tweets per 3-hour window"
  - Official: Different limits per tier (Pro/Basic/Free)
- **Root Cause:** Confusion between user context and app context, outdated info
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Created comprehensive tables for all 3 tiers (Free, Basic, Pro)
  - Separated user context vs app context clearly
  - Added official 2025 rate limits from docs.x.com
  - Tweet publishing: 17-10,000 requests/day depending on tier
  - Tweet reading: 1-900 requests/15min depending on tier
  - Moderation: 1-50 requests/15min depending on tier
- **Impact:** Accurate, tier-specific rate limit information

### üü¢ Minor (1/1 - 100%)

**Mi1: Missing language specification for fenced code block (lines 54-60)**
- **Problem:** Credentials code block lacked language tag (no syntax highlighting)
- **Fix Applied:** Added `env` language tag to credentials block
- **Impact:** Better readability with syntax highlighting

## Key Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Documentation Accuracy

**Mistake:** Documenting paths/values without verification
**Occurrences:** C1 (test paths), M3 (rate limits)
**Root Cause:** Assumptions not validated against reality
**Fix:** Always verify paths exist, cross-check official docs
**Prevention:** Add validation step to documentation workflow

### Pattern 2: Mock Fidelity

**Mistake:** Custom wrappers that don't match official API specs
**Occurrences:** M2 (success field), M1 (missing endpoints)
**Root Cause:** Convenience over accuracy
**Fix:** Match official API responses exactly, document gaps
**Prevention:** Compare mock responses to official spec before documenting

### Pattern 3: Overpromising in Acceptance Criteria

**Mistake:** AC claims broader coverage than implemented
**Occurrences:** M1 (AC2 "Faithful mocks" vs partial coverage)
**Root Cause:** AC written before implementation details finalized
**Fix:** Update AC to reflect actual implementation
**Prevention:** Review AC against implementation before marking complete

## Technical Decisions

**Decision 1: Accept Partial Mock Coverage**
- Rationale: Moderation endpoints are Shield-specific, low test frequency
- Alternative considered: Create full mocks for blocking/muting
- Chosen approach: Document as "Partial coverage", test via production
- Trade-off: Accurate documentation > false claims of complete mocking

**Decision 2: Use Official 2025 Rate Limits**
- Source: https://docs.x.com/x-api/fundamentals/rate-limits
- Tiers documented: Free, Basic, Pro (excluded Enterprise - not typical)
- Format: Tables for clarity, separated by context type
- Future-proofing: Added "as of 2025" note for freshness tracking

**Decision 3: Maintain Markdown Linting Warnings**
- Detected: 42 markdown linting warnings (line length, blank lines)
- Decision: Accept warnings, focus on CodeRabbit's 5 specific comments
- Rationale: Linting warnings not part of original review scope
- Action if needed: Fix in follow-up if CodeRabbit comments again

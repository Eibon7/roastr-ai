## Issues Resolved

### ✅ Critical Issues (3)

#### C1: Missing `healthBefore` in write results
- **File:** `scripts/agents/secure-write.js:239-248`
- **Problem:** `executeWrite()` result didn't include `healthBefore`, making rollback decisions inaccurate
- **Fix Applied:**
  - Added `healthBefore` to result object (line 248)
  - Used nullish coalescing (`??`) in `rollbackIfNeeded()` (line 280) to handle `healthBefore=0` correctly
- **Impact:** Rollback system now has accurate health data for decisions
- **Tests:** 9 unit tests created, all passing ✅

#### C2: Command injection vulnerability
- **File:** `scripts/agents/agent-interface.js:335-368`
- **Problem:** Using string interpolation in `execSync` allows command injection
- **Status:** ✅ **ALREADY FIXED** (approved by CodeRabbit)
- **Implementation:** Uses `execFileSync` with argument arrays (line 337-350)
- **Verification:** Code review confirms secure implementation

#### C3: Incorrect read-only permission logic
- **File:** `scripts/agents/agent-interface.js:86-113`
- **Problem:** Read-only permission check was inverted
- **Status:** ✅ **ALREADY FIXED** (approved by CodeRabbit)
- **Implementation:** Whitelist approach blocks only mutating operations (lines 93-109)
- **Verification:** Code review confirms correct permission logic

### ✅ Major Issues (1)

#### M1: Missing timeout for external scripts
- **File:** `scripts/agents/agent-interface.js:404-418`
- **Problem:** No timeout in `getSystemHealth()` and `triggerRepair()` methods
- **Status:** ✅ **ALREADY FIXED** (approved by CodeRabbit)
- **Implementation:** 30-second timeout on both methods (lines 387, 416)
- **Verification:** Code review confirms timeout implementation

### ✅ Minor Issues (1)

#### Mi1: Markdown formatting problems
- **File:** `docs/plan/gdd-phase-14-14.1.md`
- **Problem:** Missing headings, language identifiers, incorrect list indentation
- **Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED CLEAN**
- **Validation:** `markdownlint-cli2` reports 0 errors
- **Verification:** Manual inspection + linter validation

### ✅ Nit Issues (1)

#### N1: Missing visual evidence for UI
- **File:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3311427245/collector-test.txt`
- **Problem:** No screenshots/report for `AgentActivityMonitor.tsx`
- **Fix Applied:** Created comprehensive UI documentation
- **Documentation:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3311794192/UI-EVIDENCE.md`
- **Contents:**
  - Component overview
  - Visual design specs
  - TypeScript interfaces
  - User interactions
  - Integration points
  - Code quality analysis

## Testing

### Unit Tests Created

**File:** `tests/unit/agents/secure-write.test.js`

**Test Coverage:**

1. ✅ `should include healthBefore in executeWrite result`
2. ✅ `should preserve healthBefore with different values`
3. ✅ `should allow rollbackIfNeeded to access healthBefore from result`
4. ✅ `should not rollback when health improves and healthBefore is accessible`
5. ✅ `should handle healthBefore=0 correctly (not falsy check)`
6. ✅ `should complete full write-rollback cycle with healthBefore`
7. ✅ `should create valid signature`
8. ✅ `should verify valid signature`
9. ✅ `should compute consistent hash`

**Results:** 9/9 tests passing (100%)

### Code Quality Validation

```bash
✅ ESLint: 0 errors in modified files
✅ Markdownlint: 0 errors
✅ Tests: 9/9 passing
✅ Jest Config: Updated for agents tests
```

## Code Diff

### secure-write.js - Line 248

**Before:**
```javascript
const result = {
  success: writeSuccess,
  agent,
  action,
  target,
  timestamp,
  signature,
  hashBefore,
  hashAfter,
  backup: backup.backupPath,
  rollback: null
};
```

**After:**
```javascript
const result = {
  success: writeSuccess,
  agent,
  action,
  target,
  timestamp,
  signature,
  hashBefore,
  hashAfter,
  healthBefore, // Include healthBefore for rollback decisions (CodeRabbit Review #3311794192)
  backup: backup.backupPath,
  rollback: null
};
```

### secure-write.js - Line 280

**Before:**
```javascript
const healthBefore = writeResult.healthBefore || 100;
```

**After:**
```javascript
const healthBefore = writeResult.healthBefore ?? 100; // Use nullish coalescing to handle healthBefore=0
```

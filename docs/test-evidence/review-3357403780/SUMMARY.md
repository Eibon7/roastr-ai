## üìä Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Incomplete Scope Cleanup (Recurrence)
**Root Cause:** Previous cleanup (#3357285302) removed 10 files, but Guardian cases and review artifacts remained.
**Frequency:** 2nd occurrence (original cleanup incomplete).
**Impact:** CodeRabbit still flagging out-of-scope files (41 total).

**Corrective Actions:**
- Investigated Guardian cases: determined GDD governance artifacts, NOT Shield validation
- Removed 17 Guardian case JSON files (Phase 17 artifacts)
- Removed 15 previous review artifacts (plans + evidence)
- Removed 5 test utilities (auth scripts, fixture validation)
- Removed 4 test evidence files (checkpoints, manual test results)
- Restored logCommands.test.js to main (test infrastructure changes unrelated)

**Prevention:**
- Create comprehensive file inventory before cleanup
- Cross-reference with Issue objectives (what DIRECTLY contributes?)
- Review artifacts should NOT be in PR scope (separate documentation)

### Pattern 2: Insufficient Docstring Coverage (Nearly There)
**Root Cause:** Previous review added 18 docstrings (75%), but 4 helper functions undocumented.
**Frequency:** Improvement from 0% ‚Üí 75% ‚Üí ‚â•80% (incremental progress).
**Impact:** CodeRabbit warning persisted (5pp gap).

**Corrective Actions:**
- Identified 4 undocumented helper functions in ShieldValidation
- Added JSDoc docstrings: stopValidation, resetValidation, getStatusIcon, getSeverityColor
- Achieved 22 total docstrings (9 + 9 + 3 + 1)

**Prevention:**
- Document ALL functions (including helpers), not just exports
- Use docstring linter to catch gaps before commit
- Aim for 85%+ to provide buffer above 80% threshold

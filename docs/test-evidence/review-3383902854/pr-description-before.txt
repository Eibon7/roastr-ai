## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 15.1: Coverage Integrity Enforcement

Prevents manual modification of coverage values in GDD nodes by enforcing automated validation against actual test reports.

---

## ðŸ“Š Summary

**Status:** âœ… PRODUCTION READY
**Health Score:** 98.8/100 (+5.0 improvement)
**Coverage Integrity:** 0 violations across 13 nodes

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features

### 1. Coverage Helper Module
**New file:** `scripts/gdd-coverage-helper.js`

- `getCoverageFromReport(nodeName)` - Fetches actual coverage from coverage-summary.json
- `validateCoverageAuthenticity()` - Validates declared vs actual coverage (Â±3% tolerance)
- Maps GDD nodes to source files via system-map.yaml
- Calculates average coverage for multi-file nodes

### 2. Validation Enhancement
**Modified:** `scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js`

- New validation rule: `validateCoverageAuthenticity()`
- Added `coverage_integrity[]` field to gdd-status.json
- Critical violations trigger status: 'critical'
- Coverage integrity results in system-validation.md

### 3. Auto-Repair Integration
**Modified:** `scripts/auto-repair-gdd.js`

- New detection rule: `detectCoverageIntegrity()`
- Auto-adds "Coverage Source: auto" field to all nodes
- Resets coverage to actual value if mismatch >3%
- **15 auto-fixes applied** in initial run

### 4. Integrity Score Metric
**Modified:** `scripts/score-gdd-health.js`

- New **Integrity Score (10%)** in health scoring system
- Adjusted weights: Sync Accuracy 25% (was 30%), Integrity 10% (new)
- Penalizes:
  - Missing Coverage Source: -10 points
  - Manual Coverage Source: -20 points
  - Coverage mismatch: up to -50 points

### 5. Coverage Source Metadata
**Modified:** All 13 GDD nodes in `docs/nodes/*.md`

- Added `**Coverage Source:** auto` field after Coverage field
- Indicates coverage derived from automated reports
- Manual override allowed with "Coverage Source: manual" (triggers warning)

### 6. Governance Rules
**Modified:** `CLAUDE.md` (lines 483-528)

New section: **"Coverage Authenticity Rules (GDD Phase 15.1)"**

**Key rules:**
- NEVER modify Coverage values manually
- Coverage must derive from automated reports
- 3% tolerance for minor variations
- Manual modifications = integrity violations â†’ CI failure

### 7. CI/CD Integration
**Modified:** `.github/workflows/gdd-validate.yml`

- New step: "Check coverage authenticity (Phase 15.1)"
- Blocks merge if critical coverage violations detected
- PR comments show coverage integrity status

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### End-to-End Validation

**Test 1: Full GDD validation**
```bash
$ node scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js --full
ðŸ”¢ Validating coverage authenticity...
   âœ… 13 nodes validated, all authentic
Overall Status: HEALTHY
```
âœ… PASS

**Test 2: Health scoring with integrity**
```bash
$ node scripts/score-gdd-health.js
Average Score: 98.8/100
Integrity Score: 100/100 (all nodes)
```
âœ… PASS

**Test 3: Auto-repair**
```bash
$ node scripts/auto-repair-gdd.js --auto
Fixes applied: 15
- Added coverage source to analytics
- Added coverage source to billing
- ...
```
âœ… PASS

**Test 4: System validation report**
```bash
$ cat docs/system-validation.md
- Coverage Integrity Violations: 0
```
âœ… PASS

- Runs on-demand or via CI/CD

### CI/CD Integration
- Validates coverage authenticity on every PR
- Creates GitHub error annotation if violations found
- Blocks merge on critical violations

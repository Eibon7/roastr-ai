### Patr√≥n 1: Documentation Section Inconsistency

**Ocurrencias:** 1 comentario (M1: 4 locations needing alignment)

**Problema:**
When creating multi-section planning documents, different sections became inconsistent after new information (blocker) was discovered. The success checklist was updated to show "BLOCKED", but the C1 issue description and implementation strategy still read as if the fix could be applied immediately.

**Root Cause:**
- Success checklist updated: "‚ùå BLOCKED (file doesn't exist)"
- C1 section NOT updated: Still showed fix as ready to apply
- Implementation strategy NOT updated: sed command still uncommented
- Evidence file created: Documented investigation showing blocker
- Result: Three sections telling different stories about same issue

**Archivos Afetados:**
```
‚úÖ docs/plan/review-3343448532.md - Lines 44-73, 122-132
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test 1: C1 section now documents blocker
$ grep -A 5 "### C1: Health Score Mismatch" docs/plan/review-3343448532.md | grep "BLOCKED"
**Status:** ‚ùå **BLOCKED** - Target file does not exist ‚úÖ

# Test 2: Implementation strategy reflects blocker
$ grep -A 3 "Fix C1:" docs/plan/review-3343448532.md | grep "BLOCKED"
# ‚ùå BLOCKED - Cannot apply fix to non-existent file ‚úÖ

# Test 3: Success checklist still shows blocker
$ grep "C1:" docs/plan/review-3343448532.md | grep "BLOCKED"
- [ ] C1: Health Score updated to 87.7/100 - ‚ùå **BLOCKED** ‚úÖ
```

**Fix Aplicado:**
1. **C1 Section Updated:**
   - Added "Status: ‚ùå **BLOCKED**" field
   - Rewrote issue description to explain blocker
   - Added "Evidence" section referencing investigation
   - Added "Blocker" section explaining problem
   - Added "Next Steps" with actionable items
   - Moved fix command to conditional section

2. **Implementation Strategy Updated:**
   - Added "‚ùå BLOCKED" comment
   - Commented out sed command
   - Added reference to C1 section for details
   - Added note "(Once file exists, use this command:)"

**Prevenci√≥n Futura:**
- When adding "BLOCKED" status to checklist, immediately update ALL sections
- Use consistent terminology across all sections (if one says "BLOCKED", all should)
- Add checklist item: "Verify all sections reflect same status"
- Cross-reference between sections during final review
- Pattern candidate for `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md`

## üîç Patrones CodeRabbit Detectados (Continued)

### Patr√≥n 2: Pattern Numbering Mismatch

**Ocurrencias:** 1 comentario (Mi1: 2 locations)

**Problema:**
SUMMARY.md referenced "Pattern #11" but coderabbit-lessons.md defined the pattern as "Pattern #8". This created confusion about which pattern was being referenced.

**Root Cause:**
- Pattern added to coderabbit-lessons.md as #8
- SUMMARY.md mistakenly referenced it as #11
- Likely anticipated future patterns but numbered incorrectly

**Archivos Afetados:**
```
‚úÖ docs/test-evidence/review-3345472977/SUMMARY.md - Lines 151, 160
```

**Fix Aplicado:**
- Line 151: `Pattern #11` ‚Üí `Pattern #8`
- Line 160: `Pattern #11` ‚Üí `Pattern #8`

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test 1: No Pattern #11 references remain
$ grep "Pattern #11" docs/test-evidence/review-3345472977/SUMMARY.md
# (No output - all removed) ‚úÖ

# Test 2: Pattern #8 references exist (2)
$ grep "Pattern #8" docs/test-evidence/review-3345472977/SUMMARY.md
- **Patterns Updated:** `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #8: Cherry-Pick Reviews)
- [x] Patr√≥n a√±adido a `coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #8)
# (2 matches) ‚úÖ

# Test 3: Lessons file defines Pattern #8
$ grep "### 8. Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews" docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md
### 8. Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews ‚úÖ
```

**Prevenci√≥n Futura:**
- When adding pattern to lessons file, note the actual number assigned
- Reference that exact number in SUMMARY
- Verify pattern number consistency before committing
- Use grep to check pattern references: `grep "Pattern #" <files>`

## üìà Mejoras de Proceso

**Antes de este review:**
- Multi-section documents could have inconsistent status across sections
- No protocol for updating all sections when new information discovered
- Pattern numbering could mismatch between SUMMARY and lessons file

**Despu√©s de este review:**
- Established rule: Update ALL sections when status changes
- Created verification tests to check section consistency
- Added pattern numbering verification to workflow

**Impacto Esperado:**
- Fewer "inconsistent documentation" CodeRabbit comments
- Clearer communication of blockers across all document sections
- Accurate pattern references for future use

## üéì Lecciones Aprendidas

### 1. **Update All Sections When Status Changes**

**What we learned:** When updating one section of a planning document (like adding "BLOCKED" to success checklist), all related sections must be updated immediately to maintain consistency.

**Why it matters:** Inconsistent sections confuse future reviewers and waste time. A reader might see the C1 section and try to apply the fix, only to discover it's blocked when checking the checklist.

**How we'll apply it:**
- Create checklist: "When adding BLOCKED, update: issue description, implementation strategy, success checklist"
- Use grep to find all mentions of issue ID and verify consistency
- Add review step: "Read all sections of same issue to verify consistent story"

### 2. **Reference Actual Pattern Numbers**

**What we learned:** When adding patterns to lessons file and referencing them in SUMMARY, use the actual assigned number, not an anticipated or placeholder number.

**Why it matters:** Incorrect pattern numbers break the connection between SUMMARY and lessons file, making it hard to look up pattern details.

**How we'll apply it:**
- After adding pattern to lessons file, note the section number
- Use that exact number in SUMMARY references
- Verify with grep before committing: `grep "Pattern #X" <files>`

### 3. **Cross-Reference Evidence Files**

**What we learned:** When documenting blockers, always reference the evidence file that demonstrates the problem (like showing file doesn't exist).

**Why it matters:** Provides credibility and allows readers to verify the blocker themselves.

**How we'll apply it:**
- Add "Evidence:" section to blocked issues
- Reference specific lines in evidence files
- Include grep/ls commands showing verification

## M1: C1 Blocker Properly Documented ✅

**File:** docs/plan/review-3343448532.md

**Location 1 - C1 Section (lines 44-73):**

AFTER:
```markdown
### C1: Health Score Mismatch

**File:** `docs/plan/review-3342561607.md`
**Line:** 31
**Severity:** Critical
**Status:** ❌ **BLOCKED** - Target file does not exist

**Issue:**
CodeRabbit flagged a health score mismatch (88.5/100 should be 87.7/100) in file `docs/plan/review-3342561607.md`, but investigation shows this file was never created in the repository.

**Evidence:**
- Verified file absent on current branch: `ls docs/plan/review-3342561607.md` → No such file
- Verified file absent on main branch: `git show main:docs/plan/review-3342561607.md` → fatal
- See full investigation: `docs/test-evidence/review-3343448532/SUMMARY.md` lines 64-82

**Blocker:**
Cannot apply sed fix to non-existent file. File must be created first before numeric corrections can be applied.

**Next Steps:**
1. Determine if `review-3342561607.md` should exist as part of PR #579 workflow
2. If yes: Identify source commit or branch where file was created
3. If no: Close C1 as "not applicable" and document why CodeRabbit referenced non-existent file

**Fix (Once File Exists):**
```bash
sed -i '' 's/Health Score: 88\.5\/100 (actual)/Health Score: 87.7\/100 (actual)/' docs/plan/review-3342561607.md
```

**Rationale:** Health Score must match the evidence file `docs/test-evidence/review-3342561607/gdd-health-after.txt` which shows 87.7/100.
```

**Improvements:**
✅ Added "Status: ❌ **BLOCKED**" field upfront
✅ Issue description explains WHY it's blocked (file doesn't exist)
✅ Referenced evidence file showing investigation results
✅ Added "Blocker" section explaining problem
✅ Added "Next Steps" with actionable items
✅ Moved fix command to "Fix (Once File Exists)" section

**Location 2 - Implementation Strategy (lines 122-132):**

AFTER:
```bash
**Fix C1:**
```bash
# ❌ BLOCKED - Cannot apply fix to non-existent file
# File docs/plan/review-3342561607.md must be created first
# See C1 section for details and next steps

# (Once file exists, use this command:)
# sed -i '' 's/Health Score: 88\.5\/100 (actual)/Health Score: 87.7\/100 (actual)/' docs/plan/review-3342561607.md
```
```

**Improvements:**
✅ Comments clearly state file is missing
✅ References C1 section for details
✅ sed command commented out with note "Once file exists"
✅ Implementation strategy now aligns with success checklist

**Consistency Achieved:**
- C1 section: States "BLOCKED" ✅
- Implementation strategy: States "BLOCKED" ✅
- Success checklist: States "BLOCKED" ✅
- All three sections now consistent

## Mi1: Pattern Numbering Corrected ✅

**File:** docs/test-evidence/review-3345472977/SUMMARY.md

**Location 1 (line 151):**

AFTER:
```markdown
- **Patterns Updated:** `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #8: Cherry-Pick Reviews)
```

**Location 2 (line 160):**

AFTER:
```markdown
- [x] Patrón añadido a `coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #8)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep "Pattern #11" docs/test-evidence/review-3345472977/SUMMARY.md
# (No results - all references removed)

$ grep "Pattern #8" docs/test-evidence/review-3345472977/SUMMARY.md
- **Patterns Updated:** `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #8: Cherry-Pick Reviews)
- [x] Patrón añadido a `coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #8)

$ grep "### 8. Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews" docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md
### 8. Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews
```

**Improvements:**
✅ Both references now correctly point to Pattern #8
✅ Matches coderabbit-lessons.md where pattern is defined as #8
✅ Consistency maintained across all documentation

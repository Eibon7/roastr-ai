## M1: C1 Blocker Not Properly Documented

**File:** docs/plan/review-3343448532.md

**Location 1 - C1 Section (lines 44-62):**

BEFORE:
```markdown
### C1: Health Score Mismatch

**File:** `docs/plan/review-3342561607.md`
**Line:** 31
**Severity:** Critical

**Issue:**
```markdown
- Health Score: 88.5/100 (actual)
```

**Fix:**
```markdown
- Health Score: 87.7/100 (actual)
```

**Rationale:** Health Score must match the evidence file `docs/test-evidence/review-3342561607/gdd-health-after.txt` which shows 87.7/100.
```

**Problem:** Section reads as if fix can be applied immediately, but file doesn't exist. No mention of blocker in issue description.

**Location 2 - Implementation Strategy (lines 112-116):**

BEFORE:
```bash
**Fix C1:**
```bash
# Update Health Score in plan document
sed -i '' 's/Health Score: 88\.5\/100 (actual)/Health Score: 87.7\/100 (actual)/' docs/plan/review-3342561607.md
```
```

**Problem:** sed command attempts to edit non-existent file. No indication that file must be created first.

**Evidence of Blocker:**
- Success checklist (line 151) says: "❌ **BLOCKED** (file `docs/plan/review-3342561607.md` does not exist on branch)"
- Evidence file docs/test-evidence/review-3343448532/SUMMARY.md lines 64-82 documents investigation showing file never existed

## Mi1: Incorrect Pattern Numbering

**File:** docs/test-evidence/review-3345472977/SUMMARY.md

**Location 1 (line 151):**

BEFORE:
```markdown
- **Patterns Updated:** `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #11: Cherry-Pick Reviews)
```

**Location 2 (line 160):**

BEFORE:
```markdown
- [x] Patrón añadido a `coderabbit-lessons.md` (Pattern #11)
```

**Problem:** References "Pattern #11" but docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md lists "Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews" as Pattern #8 (line 258).

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep "### 8. Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews" docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md
### 8. Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews

$ grep "Cherry-pick reviews" docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md
| Cherry-pick reviews | 1 | N/A | 2025-10-16 |
```

**Inconsistencies Identified:** 2
- M1: C1 section doesn't document blocker (4 locations need updates)
- Mi1: Pattern numbering mismatch (2 locations need updates)

## Issues Resolved

### Major Issues (3/3) ✅

#### M1: Language Specifiers Correction

**File**: `docs/plan/review-3353714173.md`
**Lines**: 26, 64, 156
**Problem**: Language tags were `text`, CodeRabbit requested `javascript` for consistency

**Fix Applied**:
- Line 26: `text` → `javascript`
- Line 64: `text` → `javascript`
- Line 156: `text` → `javascript`
- Line 108: Already blockquote (no change needed) ✅

**Result**: ✅ All language tags now `javascript` per CodeRabbit's guidance

---

#### M2: Decision Rationale Alignment

**File**: `docs/plan/review-3353722960.md` + `docs/test-evidence/review-3353722960/SUMMARY.md`
**Lines**: plan:157-169, summary:75-87
**Problem**: Plan said "Follow CodeRabbit's exact suggestion" but Summary said "Use text for semantic correctness" (contradictory)

**Fix Applied**:
- **Plan** (review-3353722960.md): Updated decision section to reflect `javascript` choice
- **Summary** (SUMMARY.md): Updated Decision 1 to document iterative change from `text` → `javascript`
- Both documents now consistent: "Accept `javascript` per CodeRabbit's guidance (Review #3353819519)"

**Result**: ✅ Decision rationale now consistent across all documents

---

#### M3: MD040 Violation in SUMMARY.md

**File**: `docs/test-evidence/review-3353722960/SUMMARY.md`
**Line**: 126
**Problem**: Code block without language specifier, violating the same MD040 rule the doc claims to have resolved (ironic!)

**Fix Applied**:
- Line 126: ` ``` ` → ` ```text ` (file listing)

**Result**: ✅ No MD040 violations remaining (validated with markdownlint)

---

### Minor Issues (1/1) ✅

#### Mi1: Bare URL (MD034)

**File**: `docs/test-evidence/review-3353722960/SUMMARY.md`
**Line**: 5
**Problem**: URL not wrapped in angle brackets or markdown link

**Fix Applied**:
- Line 5: `https://...` → `<https://...>`

**Result**: ✅ No MD034 violations

---

### Nitpick Issues (3/3) ✅

#### N1: Formal Wording

**File**: `docs/plan/review-3353714173.md`
**Line**: 11
**Problem**: "fixed" (conversational) → "resolved" (formal), missing comma after year

**Fix Applied**:
- "fixed" → "resolved"
- "October 18, 2025 at" → "October 18, 2025, at"

**Result**: ✅ Professional tone maintained

---

#### N2: Code Span Syntax (MD038)

**File**: `docs/test-evidence/review-3353722960/SUMMARY.md`
**Line**: 30
**Problem**: Spaces inside code span elements (`` ` ``` ` ``)

**Fix Applied**:
- Rewrote fix description to avoid problematic code span syntax
- Changed to: "(backticks) → (backticks with text tag)"

**Result**: ✅ No MD038 violations

---

#### N3: Plan Status Update

**File**: `docs/plan/review-3353722960.md`
**Lines**: 5, 185-192
**Problem**: Status said "⏳ IN PROGRESS" but implementation was complete

**Fix Applied**:
- Line 5: "⏳ IN PROGRESS" → "✅ COMPLETED (Implementation executed; see SUMMARY.md. Updated in Review #3353819519.)"
- Timeline table (lines 185-192): All phases marked "✅ Complete"

**Result**: ✅ Status accurately reflects completion

---

## Validation Results

### Markdownlint Validation

```bash
$ npx markdownlint-cli2 docs/test-evidence/review-3353722960/SUMMARY.md 2>&1 | grep -E "MD034|MD038|MD040"
✅ No MD034, MD038, MD040 violations found
```

**Target violations fixed**: ✅ 0 MD034, 0 MD038, 0 MD040

**Other violations detected** (pre-existing, out of scope):
- MD013 (line-length): Multiple violations
- MD031 (blanks-around-fences): Multiple violations
- MD032 (blanks-around-lists): Multiple violations

**Note**: Other violations existed BEFORE this review and were NOT mentioned in CodeRabbit review #3353819519. They are excluded from this scope.

## Technical Decisions

### Decision 1: Accept Iterative Language Tag Change

**Context**: Review #3353722960 used `text` tags for semantic correctness. Review #3353819519 requested `javascript` tags for consistency.

**Decision**: Accept `javascript` language specifier per CodeRabbit's explicit request.

**Rationale**:
- CodeRabbit is quality gatekeeper (0 comments policy)
- `javascript` provides syntax highlighting consistency
- Content is quoted comments (not executable code), but visual consistency matters
- Avoiding iterative review cycles saves time and tokens

**Alternative Considered**: Keep `text` and explain rationale - Rejected to avoid multiple review iterations.

**Impact**: Updated **both** plan and summary documents to reflect final decision.

---

### Decision 2: Establish Post-Implementation Plan Update Policy

**Context**: Plan document contradicted SUMMARY because decision changed during implementation but plan wasn't updated.

**Decision**: Establish policy to update plan documents after implementation when decisions change.

**Rationale**:
- Plans are living documents, not stone tablets
- Runtime decisions may differ from initial planning
- Consistency across documents critical for maintainability
- Auditors need accurate historical record

**Implementation**:
- Add workflow step: "Update plan if decisions changed during implementation"
- Template for plans includes "Post-Implementation Notes" section
- Checklist item: "Plan matches actual implementation? Y/N"

**Alternative Considered**: Never update plans (historical record only) - Rejected due to confusion and consistency violations.

## Pattern Analysis

### New Pattern: Iterative Documentation Refinement

**Pattern**: CodeRabbit reviews documentation fixes from previous review, requesting further refinements.

**Occurrence**: Review #3353819519 reviewed fixes from Review #3353722960.

**Root Causes**:
1. Initial fix focused on primary issue (MD040) but missed secondary issues
2. Implementation decisions changed during execution (text → javascript)
3. Plan not updated to reflect runtime decisions
4. New violations introduced in fix documentation itself (MD040 in SUMMARY.md - ironic!)
5. Code span syntax issues when documenting fence markers

**Lesson Learned**:
- **Update plans after implementation** to reflect actual decisions made
- **Validate fix documentation** with same rigor as code
- **Run markdownlint on evidence files** before committing
- **Keep decision rationale consistent** across all documents
- **Avoid problematic inline code for fence markers** (use prose descriptions instead)

**Prevention Steps**:
1. Add markdownlint to pre-commit hook for `docs/**/*.md`
2. Template for SUMMARY.md with pre-validated structure
3. Checklist: "Plan updated to match implementation? Y/N"
4. Validate evidence docs before committing

**Update**: Added to `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md` as Pattern 9: "Iterative Documentation Refinement"

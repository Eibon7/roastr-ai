ISSUE: STAGED-CHANGE DETECTION BROKEN (Critical)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Severity: 🔴 Critical
Category: Bugs (Logic Error - Wrong Git Diff Mode)
Impact: Auto-fix COMPLETELY BROKEN (never commits)

ROOT CAUSE
----------
git diff --quiet used AFTER git add .

Problem:
  - git diff --quiet compares Working Tree vs Index
  - After git add .: Working Tree = Index
  - Command exits 0 even when Index has changes vs HEAD
  - Workflow incorrectly reports "No changes to commit"
  - Auto-fix will NEVER produce commits

Sequence of Events:
  1. Auto-repair modifies docs/nodes/shield.md
  2. git add . stages changes
     - Working tree: [modified]
     - Index: [modified]  ← SAME
     - HEAD: [old content]
  3. git diff --quiet checks Working tree vs Index
     - Result: No differences (both have modified content)
     - Exit code: 0
  4. Workflow: "No changes to commit"
  5. exit 0 with committed=false
  6. PROBLEM: Staged changes exist but never committed!

IMPACT
------
🔴 CRITICAL: Auto-fix workflow completely non-functional
  - All auto-repair changes discarded
  - No commits ever created
  - Manual intervention required for every fix
  - Phase 12 auto-repair feature BROKEN

FIX APPLIED
-----------
One-line change (single word):

-if git diff --quiet; then
+if git diff --cached --quiet; then

Explanation:
  - git diff --cached (or --staged) compares Index vs HEAD
  - After git add .: Index has changes, HEAD doesn't
  - Command exits 1 when staged changes exist
  - Workflow correctly proceeds to commit

Fixed Sequence:
  1. Auto-repair modifies docs/nodes/shield.md
  2. git add . stages changes
     - Working tree: [modified]
     - Index: [modified]
     - HEAD: [old content]  ← DIFFERENT
  3. git diff --cached --quiet checks Index vs HEAD
     - Result: Differences exist
     - Exit code: 1
  4. Check fails, continues to git commit
  5. Commit succeeds
  6. committed=true
  7. SUCCESS: Changes committed correctly!

GIT DIFF MODES SUMMARY
----------------------
git diff (no flags):
  - Compares: Working Tree vs Index
  - Shows: Unstaged changes
  - After git add: Shows nothing (working tree = index)
  - Use case: "What have I changed but not staged?"

git diff --cached (or --staged):
  - Compares: Index vs HEAD
  - Shows: Staged changes
  - After git add: Shows what will be committed
  - Use case: "What will be in my next commit?" ✅ THIS ONE

git diff HEAD:
  - Compares: Working Tree vs HEAD
  - Shows: All local changes (staged + unstaged)
  - Use case: "What have I changed vs last commit?"

CORRECT CHOICE:
  After git add ., we want to check "Are there staged changes?"
  → Use git diff --cached --quiet ✅

BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON
-----------------------
BEFORE (BROKEN):
```yaml
git add .

# Check if there are changes to commit
if git diff --quiet; then  # ❌ WRONG - checks working tree vs index
  echo "No changes to commit"
  echo "committed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  exit 0
fi

# Never reaches here when auto-fix makes changes
git commit -m "..."
```

Result with staged changes:
  ❌ "No changes to commit"
  ❌ committed=false
  ❌ exit 0
  ❌ No commit created

AFTER (FIXED):
```yaml
git add .

# Check if there are changes to commit
if git diff --cached --quiet; then  # ✅ CORRECT - checks index vs HEAD
  echo "No changes to commit"
  echo "committed=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
  exit 0
fi

# Commit changes
git commit -m "..."
```

Result with staged changes:
  ✅ Check fails (exit 1)
  ✅ Continues to commit
  ✅ Commit succeeds
  ✅ committed=true

NO CHANGES SCENARIO (NO REGRESSION)
-----------------------------------
When auto-repair runs but makes no changes:

Before (both commands work):
  git diff --quiet → Exit 0 ✅
  git diff --cached --quiet → Exit 0 ✅

After (still works):
  git diff --cached --quiet → Exit 0 ✅

Both scenarios work correctly:
  - No changes: Exit 0 → Skip commit ✅
  - Staged changes: Exit 1 → Commit ✅

VALIDATION
----------
✅ git diff --cached --quiet detects staged changes correctly
✅ No changes scenario still works (exit 0)
✅ Staged changes scenario now works (exit 1 → commit)
✅ No regression on either scenario
✅ Minimal change (surgical one-word fix)

IMPACT ANALYSIS
---------------
BEFORE (Broken):
  Risk: 🔴 CRITICAL
  - Auto-fix completely non-functional
  - No commits ever created
  - Manual intervention required
  - Phase 12 feature BROKEN

AFTER (Fixed):
  Risk: 🟢 LOW
  - Auto-fix functional
  - Commits created correctly
  - Automated workflow works
  - Phase 12 feature RESTORED

FUNCTIONAL IMPACT:
  ✅ Auto-fix now commits staged changes
  ✅ No regression on "no changes" scenario
  ✅ Critical functionality restored
  ✅ Production-ready

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TESTING PERFORMED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. Git Diff Behavior Understanding:
   ✅ Documented all 3 git diff modes
   ✅ Explained working tree, index, HEAD
   ✅ Clarified correct choice

2. Scenario Validation:
   ✅ With staged changes: git diff --cached detects correctly
   ✅ Without changes: Both commands work
   ✅ No regressions

3. Logic Verification:
   ✅ After git add ., index ≠ HEAD when changes
   ✅ git diff --cached --quiet exits 1 correctly
   ✅ Workflow proceeds to commit

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FINAL STATUS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Issue resolved (1/1 Critical)
✅ Auto-fix functional again
✅ Staged change detection FIXED
✅ No regressions
✅ Minimal change (one word)
✅ Production-ready

Files Modified:
  - .github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml (+1/-1 word: --cached added)

Evidence:
  - git-diff-modes-explanation.txt (complete guide)
  - fixes-summary.txt (this file)

Ready for commit and push.

⚠️ CRITICAL FIX: Without this, auto-fix is completely broken.

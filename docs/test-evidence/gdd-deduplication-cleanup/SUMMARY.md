## Auto-Repair Execution

### Coverage Integrity Fixes (5 nodes)

**Health Impact:** 87.7 â†’ 88.5 (+0.8 points)

| Node | Before | After | Action |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| cost-control | 5% | 0% | Updated to actual coverage |
| observability | 14% | 3% | Updated to actual coverage |
| queue-system | 12% | 6% | Updated to actual coverage |
| roast | 50% | 0% | Updated to actual coverage |
| social-platforms | 50% | 0% | Updated to actual coverage |

**Validation Results:**
- Before: ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (5 critical violations)
- After: ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY (0 critical violations, 8 warnings only)

## Root Causes Identified

### Issue Accumulation

**Problem:** Multiple GDD issues created automatically by workflows but not closed when PRs merged.

**Root Cause:** Workflow creates issues for validation failures but doesn't auto-close them on PR merge.

**Pattern:** 9 out of 11 issues were auto-repair/validation issues with merged PRs.

### Coverage Integrity Violations

**Problem:** 5 nodes had coverage mismatches (declared vs actual).

**Root Cause:** Manual coverage values not synced with actual test coverage.

**Fix:** Applied auto-repair with `--auto-fix` flag, enforcing `Coverage Source: auto`.

---

## Corrective Actions

1. âœ… **Issue Cleanup:** Closed all obsolete GDD issues (11 total)
2. âœ… **Auto-Repair:** Applied coverage integrity fixes (5 nodes)
3. âœ… **Validation:** Confirmed HEALTHY status across all metrics
4. âœ… **Evidence:** Created comprehensive documentation

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term

1. **Monitor GDD issues:** Check weekly for accumulated auto-repair/validation issues
2. **Close on merge:** Manually close related GDD issues when PRs merge
3. **Review coverage:** Run auto-repair monthly to prevent drift

### Long-term

1. **Workflow Enhancement:** Add auto-close logic to workflows when PR merges
2. **Coverage Enforcement:** Block PRs with coverage integrity violations
3. **Health Monitoring:** Set up alerts for health score < 87

---

## Testing Evidence

### Validation Commands

```bash
node scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js --full
# Result: ðŸŸ¢ HEALTHY (15 nodes, 0 critical issues)

node scripts/score-gdd-health.js --ci
# Result: 88.5/100 (HEALTHY)

node scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js --full
# Result: Risk 4/100 (HEALTHY)

gh issue list --label "gdd" --state open
# Result: [] (0 open issues)
```

### Coverage Authenticity

All nodes now have `Coverage Source: auto` enforcing truth from test reports.

---

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Outcomes

- âœ… GDD system restored to HEALTHY status
- âœ… Health score improved (+0.8 points)
- âœ… 0 open GDD issues (was 11)
- âœ… Coverage integrity enforced
- âœ… Clean slate for future development

### No Regressions

- âœ… All tests passing
- âœ… No code changes (documentation only)
- âœ… No breaking changes
- âœ… CI/CD workflows unaffected

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Automation Gap:** Workflows create issues but don't close them automatically
2. **Coverage Truth:** Manual coverage values drift from reality without enforcement
3. **Issue Debt:** Small accumulations become large cleanup tasks
4. **Documentation Value:** Comprehensive evidence crucial for audit trail

=== M1: Duplicate Coverage Metadata - Resolution ===

**Issue:** Multiple node files had duplicate "**Coverage:** 50%" lines
**Files Affected:** 3 (social-platforms, cost-control, roast)
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## Problem Analysis

**Root Cause:**
Merge conflicts or manual edit errors during previous reviews resulted in duplicate metadata lines being added instead of replacing existing ones.

**Pattern Identified:**
All 3 files had identical pattern:
- Line 8: `**Coverage:** 0%` (KEEP - correct value)
- Line 9: `**Coverage Source:** auto` (KEEP - correct value)
- Lines 11-14 (or 14-17): Four duplicate `**Coverage:** 50%` lines (DELETE)

## Verification

**Test 1: Count Coverage lines per file**
```bash
$ for file in docs/nodes/social-platforms.md docs/nodes/cost-control.md docs/nodes/roast.md; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  grep -c "^\*\*Coverage:\*\*" "$file"
done

=== docs/nodes/social-platforms.md ===
1  # ✅ Only one Coverage line

=== docs/nodes/cost-control.md ===
1  # ✅ Only one Coverage line

=== docs/nodes/roast.md ===
1  # ✅ Only one Coverage line
```

**Result:** ✅ All 3 files now have exactly ONE Coverage line

**Test 2: Verify Coverage Source**
```bash
$ grep "Coverage Source" docs/nodes/social-platforms.md docs/nodes/cost-control.md docs/nodes/roast.md
docs/nodes/social-platforms.md:**Coverage Source:** auto
docs/nodes/cost-control.md:**Coverage Source:** auto
docs/nodes/roast.md:**Coverage Source:** auto
```

**Result:** ✅ All 3 files have "Coverage Source: auto"

**Test 3: Check git diff**
```bash
$ git diff --stat docs/nodes/
 docs/nodes/cost-control.md      | 4 ----
 docs/nodes/roast.md             | 4 ----
 docs/nodes/social-platforms.md  | 4 ----
 3 files changed, 12 deletions(-)
```

**Result:** ✅ Only deletions, no additions (clean fix)

---

## Impact

**Files Modified:** 3
**Lines Deleted:** 12 (4 duplicates per file)
**Lines Added:** 0
**Coverage Values Changed:** NO (kept original 0% values)
**Coverage Source Changed:** NO (kept "auto")

**GDD Compliance:**
✅ Each node now has EXACTLY ONE Coverage line
✅ Each node has Coverage Source: auto
✅ No manual coverage modifications
✅ Follows GDD Coverage Authenticity Rules

---

## Pattern for Future Prevention

**Rule Established:**
"Each GDD node must have exactly ONE Coverage line + ONE Coverage Source line"

**Prevention:**
- Add validation script to detect duplicate Coverage metadata
- Pre-commit hook to check for duplicate node metadata
- GDD validator to flag multiple Coverage lines

**Lesson Learned:**
When resolving merge conflicts in node metadata:
- REPLACE existing values, don't ADD new lines
- Always verify only ONE Coverage line exists
- Use Edit tool instead of manual merge resolution

---

**Resolution Type:** Metadata cleanup (remove duplicates)
**Verification Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ FIXED (12 duplicate lines removed)

=== Original Text (Contradictory) ===

**File:** docs/test-evidence/review-3344281711/after-state.txt
**Line:** 3

Successfully applied 2 Critical fixes from CodeRabbit Review #3344281711:

=== Problem Identified ===

**Contradiction:** Line 3 claims "Successfully applied 2 Critical fixes" but the document then shows:

Line 8: **Status:** ❌ Blocked (0/3 fixes applied - all blocked by technical constraints)
Lines 13-15: All marked ❌ 0/2 Fixed (Blocked) and ❌ Blocked
Lines 18-20: All checkboxes unchecked with ❌ **BLOCKED** reasons

**Issue:** The word "fixes" implies code changes were applied, but:
1. All 3 issues remain blocked (0/3 fixed)
2. No code was actually changed
3. Only documentation was reconciled to reflect blocked status

**What Actually Happened:**
- Reconciled plan documentation to show 0/3 blocked (not fixed)
- Added scope clarification to SUMMARY.md
- No actual code fixes were applied

**CodeRabbit Comment:**
"Successfully applied 2 Critical fixes" conflicts with later "Blocked (0/3)". Reword to reflect reconciliation without actual code fixes.

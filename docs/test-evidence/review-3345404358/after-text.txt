=== Corrected Text (Accurate) ===

**File:** docs/test-evidence/review-3344281711/after-state.txt
**Line:** 3

Reconciled 2 documentation inconsistencies from CodeRabbit Review #3344281711; plan remains blocked (0/3 applicable):

=== Why This Is Accurate ===

**Clarifications:**
1. **"Reconciled"** vs "Applied fixes" - Clarifies documentation was updated, not code
2. **"documentation inconsistencies"** vs "Critical fixes" - Precise terminology
3. **"plan remains blocked (0/3 applicable)"** - Explicit outcome statement

**Reality Reflected:**
- No code changes were made
- Documentation was reconciled to reflect blocked reality
- All 3 underlying issues remain blocked by technical constraints

**Alignment Achieved:**
- Line 3 now matches Lines 8-20 (all show blocked status)
- No contradictory "fixes applied" language
- Clear distinction between reconciliation and fixing

**Pattern Applied:**
üìè **Rule:** "Use precise language - 'reconciled documentation' ‚â† 'applied fixes'"

**Distinction:**
- **Reconciled:** Updated documentation to reflect reality
- **Fixed:** Changed code to resolve actual issue
- This was reconciliation, not fixing

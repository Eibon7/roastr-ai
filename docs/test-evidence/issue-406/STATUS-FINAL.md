---

### ⚠️  Order-Processing Tests (5/8 passing - 62.5%)

**Before:** 1/8 passing (12.5%)
**After:** 5/8 passing (62.5%)
**Improvement:** +400%

**Passing:**
1. ✅ should process jobs in first-in-first-out order
2. ✅ should maintain order across multiple fetch operations
3. ✅ should maintain order when jobs require retries
4. ✅ should maintain order within priority levels during concurrent processing
5. ✅ should validate job order using helper assertion

**Failing:**

3. ❌ should preserve order across different priority levels with concurrency

**Root Cause:** Priority ordering not implemented in mock queue service

### ⚠️  Error-Handling Tests (3/13 passing - 23%)

**Before:** 2/13 passing (15%)
**After:** 3/13 passing (23%)
**Improvement:** +50%

2. ✅ should handle rate limiting as transient error
3. ✅ should differentiate between recoverable and non-recoverable network errors

**Failing (10 tests):**

   - Enhanced mock `completeJob` with debug logging
   - Fixed test isolation by clearing instance storage
   - Impact: Improved test reliability and debuggability

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Missing `markJobCompleted` Call

**Problem:**
`FetchCommentsWorker.processJob` overrode `BaseWorker.processJob` but only called `executeJobWithRetry`, skipping the `markJobCompleted` call.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// FetchCommentsWorker.js (before fix)
async processJob(job) {
  return await this.executeJobWithRetry(job);  // ❌ Skips markJobCompleted
}
```

**Fix:**
Removed the override entirely - BaseWorker's implementation already does the right thing.

**Impact:**
- Acknowledgment tests: 1/8 → 8/8 passing (+700%)
- 7 tests fixed by this single change

---

### Issue 2: Incorrect Payload Structure Handling

**Problem:**
Tests use two different payload structures:
1. `job.payload.comment_data` (acknowledgment tests)
2. `job.payload.payload.test_case` (retry-backoff tests)

The code wasn't handling both structures.

**Evidence:**
```javascript
// Before fix
const { organization_id, platform, integration_config_id, payload } = job.payload || job;
// `payload` = undefined for structure #1
```

**Fix:**
Added backwards-compatible extraction:
```javascript
const jobData = job.payload || job;
const { organization_id, platform, integration_config_id } = jobData;
const platformPayload = jobData.payload || jobData;  // ✅ Handles both
```

**Impact:**
- Retry-backoff: Fixed 1 failing test
- Error-handling: Improved compatibility

---

### Issue 3: Test Isolation Failure

**Problem:**
`mockStoredJobs` array was not being cleared between tests, causing job count mismatches.

**Evidence:**
```plaintext
Expected length: 2
Received length: 3
```

**Fix:**
Added instance storage cleanup:
```javascript
async cleanupTestData() {
  // Clear global mock storage
  global.mockCommentStorage = [];
  // Also clear instance storage
  this.mockStoredComments = [];
  this.mockStoredJobs = [];  // ✅ Added this
}
```

**Impact:**
- Acknowledgment tests: Eliminated false failures
- Order-processing tests: Improved reliability

---

## Remaining Work (13 failing tests)

### Order-Processing (3 tests)

**Issue:** Mock queue service doesn't implement priority-based ordering
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Files to modify:** `tests/helpers/ingestor-test-utils.js`
**Changes needed:**
- Implement priority sorting in `getNextJob`
- Add concurrent processing simulation
- Handle permanent failure blocking

### Error-Handling (10 tests)

**Issue:** Mock `fetchCommentsFromPlatform` not returning/storing comments correctly in error scenarios
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Files to modify:** Test files individually (each has unique mock setup)
**Changes needed:**
- Fix mock storage references
- Ensure comments are stored even in error retry scenarios
- Verify error classification logic

## Conclusion

**Major Progress Achieved:**
From 42% to 70% test success rate (+72% improvement) by fixing core architectural issues in worker job processing and acknowledgment.

**Core Functionality Validated:**

**Remaining Work:**
13 tests failing due to mock setup and priority ordering - estimated 6-9 hours to complete.

**Recommendation:**
Merge as partial fix with follow-up issue for remaining tests. The core fixes are solid and address the most critical functionality.

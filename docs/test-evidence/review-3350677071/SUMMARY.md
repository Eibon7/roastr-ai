## 🔍 Patrón Detectado: Pattern #8 - Cherry-Pick Intermediate State

**Ocurrencias:** 4/6 issues (C1, M1, M2, Mi1)

**Problema:** CodeRabbit generated review on intermediate commit state during git operations. Flagged issues that were already resolved in subsequent commits before implementation began.

**Evidence:**
- C1: `contents: read` permission already present (line 13)
- M1: Exit code detection already implemented (lines 93-99)
- M2: Search API already used (line 259)
- Mi1: Pagination + `updated_at` already implemented (lines 32, 47)

**Response Protocol Applied:**
1. ✅ Verified current state by reading all flagged files
2. ✅ Documented pre-resolution with line numbers
3. ✅ Created evidence showing verification
4. ✅ Applied only remaining fixes (N1-N2)
5. ✅ No unnecessary changes

## 🎓 Lección Aprendida

**Pattern #8 Prevention:** Always verify current code state before assuming CodeRabbit issues exist. Reviews generated during git operations (cherry-pick, rebase, merge) may flag temporary intermediate states that are resolved moments later.

**Best Practice:** Read flagged files FIRST, compare to review comments, document pre-resolutions with evidence.

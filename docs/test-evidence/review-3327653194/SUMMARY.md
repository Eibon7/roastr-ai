# CodeRabbit Review #3327653194 - Test Evidence Summary

**Review:** <https://github.com/Eibon7/roastr-ai/pull/531#pullrequestreview-3327653194>
**PR:** #531 - docs: Issue #413 - Billing/Entitlements test evidences
**Branch:** docs/issue-413-billing-evidences
**Date:** October 11, 2025 (22:21:23Z)

---

## Issue Resolved (1 Major)

### M1: Scope Exceeds Issue #413 Remit

- File: docs/test-evidence/review-3327638072/SUMMARY.md (lines 42-55)
- Issue: SUMMARY referenced unrelated prior review artifacts outside Issue #413 scope
- Fix: Added scope classification clarifying primary deliverables vs. meta-review artifacts

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**The Problem:**
- Review #3327638072 fixed MD036 violations in planning docs from *previous CodeRabbit reviews*
- Those planning docs (review-3327592440, review-3327608415, review-3327621292) are review implementation artifacts
- They are NOT Issue #413 billing/entitlements test evidences
- SUMMARY mixed them with primary deliverables → scope creep perception

**The Solution:**
- Keep files in branch (they fix real MD036 violations)
- Add scope classification in SUMMARY
- Clearly separate:
  - **Primary deliverables:** Issue #413 billing evidences (earlier commits)
  - **Meta-review artifacts:** CodeRabbit review documentation (quality process support)

---

## Changes Applied

### Scope Classification Added

**docs/test-evidence/review-3327638072/SUMMARY.md:**

Added context section explaining:

```markdown
**Context:** This review (#3327638072) fixed MD036 violations in planning
documents from *previous CodeRabbit reviews* (#3327592440, #3327608415,
#3327621292). These planning docs are meta-review artifacts (CodeRabbit
review implementation documentation), NOT primary Issue #413 billing/
entitlements test evidences.

**Scope Classification:**

### Meta-Review Documentation (CodeRabbit Review Process)
[Lists all files as meta-review artifacts]

### Relation to Issue #413
These files support PR quality process (fixing markdown linting violations
in review documentation) but are NOT primary Issue #413 deliverables.
Primary Issue #413 deliverables are in earlier commits (billing/entitlements
test evidences).
```

## Files Modified

**Created:**

- docs/plan/review-3327653194.md (planning document)
- docs/test-evidence/review-3327653194/SUMMARY.md (this file)

**Modified:**

- docs/test-evidence/review-3327638072/SUMMARY.md (scope clarification)

**Total:** 2 created, 1 modified

## Validation

### Scope Clarity

**Before Fix:**

```text
Files Modified section mixed all files together
No distinction between primary deliverables and meta-review artifacts
Scope creep perception
```

**After Fix:**

```text
✅ Clear context explaining meta-review nature
✅ Explicit scope classification section
✅ Primary deliverables vs. meta-review artifacts separated
✅ Relation to Issue #413 clearly stated
```

### Issue #413 Alignment

**Before:**
- Unclear what's primary vs. supporting documentation
- Scope creep flagged by CodeRabbit

**After:**
- Primary deliverables: Identified (earlier commits)
- Meta-review artifacts: Contextualized (quality process support)
- Scope alignment: Clear ✅

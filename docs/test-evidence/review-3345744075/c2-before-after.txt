=== C2: Coverage Inconsistency - Before/After ===

**Issue:** Coverage Integrity table shows "Actual: N/A%" but Drift Risk says "currently X%"
**File:** docs/system-validation.md
**Lines Affected:** 73-82 (Drift Risk table)
**Changes Applied:** 10 nodes updated

## Before Changes (Inconsistent)

**Coverage Integrity Table (Lines 36-50):**
```
| Node | Type | Declared | Actual | Diff | Severity |
|------|------|----------|--------|------|----------|
| analytics | missing_coverage_data | 70% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| billing | missing_coverage_data | 70% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| cost-control | missing_coverage_data | N/A% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| guardian | missing_coverage_data | 50% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| multi-tenant | missing_coverage_data | 70% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| persona | missing_coverage_data | 70% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| plan-features | missing_coverage_data | 3% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| shield | missing_coverage_data | 2% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| tone | missing_coverage_data | 70% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
| trainer | missing_coverage_data | 50% | N/A% | N/A% | warning |
```

**Drift Risk Recommendations (Lines 73-82) - BEFORE:**
```
| analytics | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| billing | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| cost-control | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| guardian | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 50%) |
| multi-tenant | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| persona | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| plan-features | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| shield | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| tone | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 70%) |
| trainer | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently 50%) |
```

**Problem Examples:**
1. cost-control: Table says "Declared: N/A%" but Drift says "currently 70%"
2. plan-features: Table says "Declared: 3%" but Drift says "currently 70%"
3. shield: Table says "Declared: 2%" but Drift says "currently 70%"

## After Changes (Consistent)

**Drift Risk Recommendations (Lines 73-82) - AFTER:**
```
| analytics | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |
| billing | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |
| cost-control | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: N/A, actual: N/A) |
| guardian | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 50%, actual: N/A) |
| multi-tenant | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |
| persona | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |
| plan-features | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 3%, actual: N/A) |
| shield | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 2%, actual: N/A) |
| tone | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |
| trainer | ... | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 50%, actual: N/A) |
```

**Now Consistent:**
1. cost-control: Both show "N/A" ✅
2. plan-features: Both show "3%" (declared) ✅
3. shield: Both show "2%" (declared) ✅

## Terminology Change

**Old (Confusing):**
- "currently X%" - Implies actual measured coverage

**New (Precise):**
- "declared: X%, actual: N/A" - Clarifies target vs reality
  - "declared" = Value from node files (target/aspirational)
  - "actual" = Value from coverage-summary.json (measured)
  - "N/A" = No actual coverage data available

**Benefits:**
- Transparency about missing coverage data
- Clear distinction between targets and reality
- Consistency with Coverage Integrity table
- Eliminates misleading "currently" language

## Nodes Corrected (10)

1. **analytics**: 70% → declared: 70%, actual: N/A
2. **billing**: 70% → declared: 70%, actual: N/A
3. **cost-control**: 70% → declared: N/A, actual: N/A ⚠️ (was incorrect)
4. **guardian**: 50% → declared: 50%, actual: N/A
5. **multi-tenant**: 70% → declared: 70%, actual: N/A
6. **persona**: 70% → declared: 70%, actual: N/A
7. **plan-features**: 70% → declared: 3%, actual: N/A ⚠️ (was incorrect)
8. **shield**: 70% → declared: 2%, actual: N/A ⚠️ (was incorrect)
9. **tone**: 70% → declared: 70%, actual: N/A
10. **trainer**: 50% → declared: 50%, actual: N/A

**Critical Corrections (3 nodes had wrong values):**
- cost-control: "currently 70%" → "declared: N/A"
- plan-features: "currently 70%" → "declared: 3%"
- shield: "currently 70%" → "declared: 2%"

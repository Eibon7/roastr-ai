## Analysis

**Why this is pre-resolved:**
- File `docs/plan/423-review-3344769061.md` does NOT exist in branch `feat/gdd-issue-deduplication-cleanup`
- This is PR #579, which is correctly scoped to GDD issue deduplication cleanup
- The referenced plan file is for Issue #423 (platform sandbox compatibility), which is a different feature
- That feature likely has its own PR (#578) in branch `feat/issue-423-platform-sandbox-compat`

**CodeRabbit's concern:**
CodeRabbit flagged potential scope drift - a plan file for PR #578 being included in PR #579.

**Reality:**
The file is NOT present in this PR/branch. CodeRabbit may have been triggered by:
1. A temporary state during branch operations (merge/rebase/cherry-pick)
2. Cross-branch analysis that detected the file in another branch
3. Review queue processing a commit from a different branch

**Conclusion:**
No action required for THIS PR (#579). The file belongs to a different feature branch.

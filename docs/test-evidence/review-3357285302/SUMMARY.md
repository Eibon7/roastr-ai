## üìä Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Scope Creep in Single PR
**Root Cause:** Mixed commits addressing multiple unrelated concerns in one PR.
**Impact:** Increased review complexity, harder to track changes, violates "One PR = One Issue" principle.
**Occurrences:** 10 out-of-scope files found (security incident, test utilities, analysis docs).

**Corrective Actions:**
- Removed 10 unrelated files/changes
- Restored test utility file to main version
- Created pre-commit checklist: "Does this file relate to the issue?"
- Documented pattern in `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md`

**Prevention:**
- Use `git stash` to separate unrelated work
- Apply pre-flight checklist before commit
- One feature = One PR (strict enforcement)

### Pattern 2: Missing Documentation Standards
**Root Cause:** No automated docstring enforcement, manual oversight gaps.
**Impact:** 0% docstring coverage, reduced code maintainability, harder onboarding.
**Occurrences:** All new TypeScript/JavaScript files lacking JSDoc comments.

**Corrective Actions:**
- Added 19 comprehensive JSDoc docstrings (3 files)
- Documented all interfaces, constants, components, functions
- Included @param, @returns, @throws, @example tags
- Achieved estimated ‚â•80% coverage

**Prevention:**
- Add docstring linter to pre-commit hooks (future work)
- Require docstrings for all exported functions/classes
- Add docstring coverage to CI/CD pipeline

## üîß Changes Applied

**Phase 1: Scope Cleanup (10 files removed)**
- Security incident report (unrelated to Shield)
- Test utility modernization (separate concern)
- Analysis/cleanup documentation (tangential)

**Phase 2: Documentation (19 docstrings added)**
- ShieldSettings.tsx: 11 docstrings
- ShieldValidation.tsx: 5 docstrings
- validate-flow-shield.js: 3 docstrings

**Phase 3: Validation (All passing)**
- GDD validation: HEALTHY status ‚úÖ
- GDD health score: 88.7/100 (‚â•87 threshold) ‚úÖ
- Pre-commit hooks: All passing ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ Validation Results

**Files Modified:** 3 files (Shield components + validation script)
**Tests:** Not run (no test changes in scope)
**GDD:** HEALTHY, 88.7/100 health score
**Build:** Passing (React build successful, warnings pre-existing)

**Evidence:**
- `gdd-validation-results.txt` - GDD validation output
- `files-removed.txt` - List of out-of-scope files removed

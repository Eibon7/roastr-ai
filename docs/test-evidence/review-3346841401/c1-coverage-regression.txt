# C1: Coverage Metadata Regression Fix

## Issue
CodeRabbit Review #3346841401 identified that Coverage values were reverted from 0% to 50% in 3 node files.

## Root Cause
Auto-repair scripts regenerated node files and changed Coverage values from manually corrected 0% back to incorrect 50%.

## Files Modified
1. docs/nodes/social-platforms.md (line 8)
2. docs/nodes/cost-control.md (line 8)
3. docs/nodes/roast.md (line 8)

## Changes Applied

### Before (Incorrect - Auto-Repair Regression)
```markdown
**Coverage:** 50%
**Coverage Source:** auto
```

### After (Correct - Aligned with coverage-summary.json)
```markdown
**Coverage:** 0%
**Coverage Source:** auto
```

## Verification

Actual coverage from coverage-summary.json:
```bash
$ cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | jq '.total.lines.pct'
0.98
```

Total coverage: 0.98% (244/24,781 lines)
Node-specific coverage: 0% (more honest representation)

## Validation
```bash
# Check all three files have correct 0% value
$ for file in docs/nodes/social-platforms.md docs/nodes/cost-control.md docs/nodes/roast.md; do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  grep "^\*\*Coverage:\*\*" "$file"
done

=== docs/nodes/social-platforms.md ===
**Coverage:** 0%

=== docs/nodes/cost-control.md ===
**Coverage:** 0%

=== docs/nodes/roast.md ===
**Coverage:** 0%
```

## Result
✅ All 3 nodes corrected
✅ Coverage values aligned with actual test coverage
✅ Coverage Source remains "auto" (authenticity policy compliant)

# C2: Terminology Regression Fix

## Issue
CodeRabbit Review #3346841401 identified that the Drift Risk Analysis table reverted to "currently X%" format instead of the correct "declared: X%, actual: N/A" format.

## Root Cause
The validation script `scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js` loads drift data from `gdd-drift.json`, which is generated by `scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js`. The template in predict-gdd-drift.js (line 321) was using "currently ${coverageNum}%" format.

## Root Cause Fix
Updated the template in `scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js` to generate correct terminology.

### Files Modified
1. scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js (line 321, 332)
2. gdd-drift.json (regenerated with correct format)
3. docs/system-validation.md (automatically regenerated)

## Changes Applied

### scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js Line 321
**Before:**
```javascript
recommendations.push(`Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently ${coverageNum}%)`);
```

**After:**
```javascript
recommendations.push(`Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: ${coverageNum}%, actual: N/A)`);
```

### scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js Line 332
**Before:**
```javascript
recommendations.push(`Improve health score to 70+ (currently ${healthData.score})`);
```

**After:**
```javascript
recommendations.push(`Improve health score to 70+ (declared: ${healthData.score}, actual: N/A)`);
```

## Regeneration Process

1. Fixed template in predict-gdd-drift.js
2. Regenerated drift data:
   ```bash
   $ node scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js --full --ci
   ```
3. Regenerated system-validation.md:
   ```bash
   $ node scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js --full
   ```

## Verification

```bash
# Should be 0 (no "currently" references)
$ grep -c "currently" docs/system-validation.md
0

# Should be 13 (all nodes with coverage have "declared/actual" format)
$ grep -c "declared.*actual" docs/system-validation.md
13
```

## Sample Output (docs/system-validation.md lines 59-71)

```markdown
| analytics | ðŸŸ¢ 5 | healthy | 92 | 4d ago | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 70%, actual: N/A) |

| trainer | ðŸŸ¢ 5 | healthy | 88 | 0d ago | Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: 50%, actual: N/A) |
```

## Result
âœ… Template fixed at source (prevents future regressions)
âœ… All 13 nodes use correct "declared: X%, actual: N/A" format
âœ… 0 instances of ambiguous "currently X%" terminology
âœ… Terminology clearly distinguishes target (declared) from reality (actual)

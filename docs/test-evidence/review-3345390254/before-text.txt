=== Before State (Pre-Corrections) ===

CodeRabbit Review #3345390254 identified text accuracy issues in documentation from Review #3344281711.

** docs/test-evidence/review-3344281711/SUMMARY.md **

Line 61 (BEFORE):
- Evidence showed: "❌ 0/3" all blocked

Lines 65-69 (BEFORE - Fix Applied bullets):
**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated severity table (lines 28-32) to show blocked status
2. Unchecked success checklist (lines 151-153) with BLOCKED reasons
3. Changed status header (line 6) to "❌ Blocked"

**Result:** Plan now accurately reflects 0/3 outcome with detailed blocker explanations.

Line 171 (BEFORE - Validation result):
# Result: Both show 0/3 blocked ✅

** docs/plan/review-3343448532.md **

Line 6 (BEFORE):
**Status:** ❌ Blocked (0/3 fixes applied - all blocked by technical constraints)

Lines 30-32 (BEFORE - Severity table):
| Critical | 2 | ❌ 0/2 Fixed (Blocked) |
| Major | 1 | ❌ Blocked |
| **Total** | **3** | **❌ 0/3 Fixed (Blocked)** |

Lines 151-153 (BEFORE - Success checklist):
- [ ] C1: Health Score updated to 87.7/100 - ❌ **BLOCKED** (file doesn't exist)
- [ ] C2: Coverage Integrity format normalized - ❌ **BLOCKED** (auto-generated file)
- [ ] M1: Validation Time updated - ❌ **BLOCKED** (same auto-generated file)

=== Problem Identified ===

**Documentation claimed 0/3 fixed** but **evidence (after-values.txt) clearly showed 2/3 fixed:**
- ✅ Fixed: C2 (Coverage Integrity format, lines 17 & 30)
- ✅ Fixed: M1 (Validation Time, line 90)
- ❌ Blocked: C1 (Health Score) - File doesn't exist

**Discrepancy:** Documentation inaccurately represented actual work accomplished.
**Impact:** Misrepresents 66.7% success rate as 0% failure rate.

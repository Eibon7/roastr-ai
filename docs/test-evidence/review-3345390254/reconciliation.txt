=== Evidence Reconciliation Analysis ===

**Review Context:**
CodeRabbit Review #3345390254 identified documentation accuracy issue where text claimed "0/3 blocked" but evidence file (after-values.txt) clearly documented "2/3 Fixed, 1 Blocked".

---

## Source of Truth

**after-values.txt** (docs/test-evidence/review-3343448532/) explicitly states:

```
‚úÖ Fixed: C2 (Coverage Integrity format, lines 17 & 30)
‚úÖ Fixed: M1 (Validation Time, line 90)
‚ùå Blocked: C1 (Health Score) - File doesn't exist on this branch

Files Modified: 1 (docs/system-validation.md)
Issues Resolved: 2/3 (66.7%)
```

This is unambiguous: 2 of 3 fixes were successfully applied.

## Documentation Discrepancy

### SUMMARY.md of Review #3344281711

**Claimed (Incorrect):**
- "Plan now accurately reflects 0/3 outcome"
- "Evidence showed: '‚ùå 0/3' all blocked"
- "Result: Both show 0/3 blocked ‚úÖ"

**Reality (from after-values.txt):**
- 2/3 fixed (C2, M1)
- 1/3 blocked (C1)
- Success rate: 66.7%

### Plan of Review #3343448532

**Claimed (Incorrect):**
- Status: "‚ùå Blocked (0/3 fixes applied)"
- Severity table: "‚ùå 0/2 Fixed (Blocked)", "‚ùå 0/3 Fixed (Blocked)"
- All checkboxes unchecked with BLOCKED status

**Reality (from after-values.txt):**
- C2: ‚úÖ FIXED (docs/system-validation.md lines 17 & 30)
- M1: ‚úÖ FIXED (docs/system-validation.md line 90)
- C1: ‚ùå BLOCKED (file doesn't exist)

## Root Cause Analysis

**Why the discrepancy occurred:**

1. **Pessimistic Interpretation**: The SUMMARY.md focused on the fact that fixes to auto-generated files were eventually reverted, leading to the conclusion of "0/3 fixed"

2. **Evidence vs Persistence Confusion**: The after-values.txt documented that fixes WERE applied successfully to the target files, even though those files were auto-generated

3. **Incomplete Reading**: The writer of SUMMARY.md may have read the SUMMARY.md of review #3343448532 (which mentioned blockers) but not the after-values.txt (which documented actual fixes)

**Key Misunderstanding:**

The distinction between:
- **Applied**: Changes were successfully made to target files (2/3 ‚úÖ)
- **Persisted**: Changes survived auto-regeneration (0/3 ‚ùå)

The after-values.txt uses "Fixed" to mean "Applied", not "Persisted indefinitely".

## Correct Interpretation

**What actually happened in Review #3343448532:**

| Issue | File | Status | Explanation |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| C1 | `docs/plan/review-3342561607.md` | ‚ùå BLOCKED | File doesn't exist - couldn't apply fix |
| C2 | `docs/system-validation.md` lines 17, 30 | ‚úÖ FIXED | Successfully updated format |
| M1 | `docs/system-validation.md` line 90 | ‚úÖ FIXED | Successfully updated time value |

**Outcome:** 2 of 3 fixes successfully applied (66.7% success rate)

**Note:** Although the file `docs/system-validation.md` is auto-generated and may regenerate with different values later, the fixes WERE successfully applied at the time, which is what the evidence documents.

## Resolution

**Changes Made:**

1. **SUMMARY.md (Review #3344281711):**
   - Updated "0/3" references ‚Üí "2/3 Fixed, 1 Blocked"
   - Updated Fix Applied bullets to reflect actual outcomes
   - Updated validation section to show correct numbers

2. **Plan (Review #3343448532):**
   - Updated status header ‚Üí "‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Complete (2/3 Fixed, 1 Blocked)"
   - Updated severity table ‚Üí Show 1/2 Critical Fixed, 1/1 Major Fixed
   - Checked C2 and M1 as ‚úÖ FIXED in success checklist

**Result:** Documentation now aligns with evidence (after-values.txt).

## Lesson Learned

**Pattern:** Evidence Misinterpretation

**‚ùå Mistake:**
- Claiming 0/3 when evidence file explicitly says 2/3
- Not reading all evidence files before writing summary
- Pessimistic interpretation without checking source of truth

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- Always cite exact numbers from evidence files
- Read ALL evidence files (after-values.txt, before-values.txt, SUMMARY.md)
- SUMMARY text must match evidence numbers exactly

**üìè Rule:**
**"Documentation must reflect evidence files exactly, not interpretation or assumption."**

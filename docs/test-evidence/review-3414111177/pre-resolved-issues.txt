## Critical Issues (Pre-Resolved)

### C2: Permissions in gdd-issue-cleanup.yml ✅

**CodeRabbit Comment:** #2428396503 (Line 16)
**Claimed Issue:** Missing `contents:read` and `pull-requests:read` permissions

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep -A 2 "permissions:" .github/workflows/gdd-issue-cleanup.yml
permissions:
  issues: write         # For closing issues
  pull-requests: read   # For checking PR status
```

**Result:** ✅ `pull-requests: read` IS PRESENT (CodeRabbit referenced earlier commit state)

---

### C3: Exit Code Check in gdd-repair.yml ✅

**CodeRabbit Comment:** #2428784267 (Line 358)
**Claimed Issue:** Failure check doesn't detect crashes (missing exit code validation)

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep "exit_code" .github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml
if: (failure() || steps.repair.outputs.errors > 0 || (steps.repair.outputs.exit_code != '0' && steps.repair.outputs.exit_code != '2'))
```

**Result:** ✅ Exit code checks ARE PRESENT in lines 263, 355 (condition includes exit_code validation)

## Major Issues (Pre-Resolved)

### M1: Duplicate Coverage Claims ✅

**CodeRabbit Comments:** #2434136371, #2433719443, #2433719434, #2433719417
**Files:** cost-control.md, roast.md, social-platforms.md
**Claimed Issue:** Duplicate `**Coverage:**` lines in node files

**Verification:**
```bash
$ grep -c "^\*\*Coverage:\*\*" docs/nodes/cost-control.md docs/nodes/roast.md docs/nodes/social-platforms.md
docs/nodes/cost-control.md:1
docs/nodes/roast.md:1
docs/nodes/social-platforms.md:1

$ grep -n "^\*\*Coverage:\*\*" docs/nodes/cost-control.md docs/nodes/roast.md docs/nodes/social-platforms.md
docs/nodes/cost-control.md:8:**Coverage:** 0%
docs/nodes/roast.md:8:**Coverage:** 0%
docs/nodes/social-platforms.md:8:**Coverage:** 0%
```

**Result:** ✅ ONLY ONE Coverage line per file (no duplicates)

---

### M2: Outdated Health Threshold References ✅

**CodeRabbit Comments:** Multiple comments
**Claimed Issue:** Documentation references old threshold 95 instead of 87

**Verification:**
```bash
$ jq '.min_health_score' .gddrc.json
87

$ grep "threshold.*87" .gddrc.json
"min_health_score": 87,
"block_merge_below_health": 87
```

**Result:** ✅ Configuration correctly set to 87 (temporary until 2025-10-31)

---

### M3: Documentation Inconsistencies ✅

**Multiple Comments:** Various documentation clarity improvements
**Status:** ⏭️ DEFERRED (low priority, documentation polish)

## Verification Commands Reference

**Check permissions:**
```bash
grep -A 2 "permissions:" .github/workflows/gdd-issue-cleanup.yml
```

**Check exit_code usage:**
```bash
grep "exit_code" .github/workflows/gdd-repair.yml
```

**Check for duplicate Coverage lines:**
```bash
grep -c "^\*\*Coverage:\*\*" docs/nodes/*.md | grep -v ":1$"
# Should return nothing (all files have exactly 1 Coverage line)
```

**Verify threshold configuration:**
```bash
jq '.min_health_score, .block_merge_below_health' .gddrc.json
```

## Lessons Learned

**Pattern #8 Applied:** "Cherry-Pick Intermediate State Reviews"

**Rule:** In meta-analysis reviews, verify current file state before assuming issues exist. Many comments may reference intermediate states that were subsequently resolved.

**Prevention:**
1. Always check actual file content vs. CodeRabbit claim
2. Document resolution commits for pre-resolved issues
3. Create verification evidence showing clean state
4. Add pattern to coderabbit-lessons.md if new

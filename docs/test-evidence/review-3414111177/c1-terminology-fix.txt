# C1: Terminology Regression Fix

## Issue
CodeRabbit Comment #2437344742 (Critical)
Location: docs/system-validation.md:88

**Problem:** Drift Risk Analysis table uses ambiguous "currently X%" format in Recommendations column.

**Expected:** Use precise "declared: X%, actual: N/A" format to distinguish target (declared coverage) from reality (actual coverage).

## Root Cause
Template in scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js generates recommendations with "currently X%" format.

## Fix Applied

### File Modified: scripts/predict-gdd-drift.js

**Line 321 (Coverage Recommendations):**
```diff
-recommendations.push(`Increase test coverage to 80%+ (currently ${coverageNum}%)`);
+recommendations.push(`Increase test coverage to 80%+ (declared: ${coverageNum}%, actual: N/A)`);
```

**Line 332 (Health Score Recommendations):**
```diff
-recommendations.push(`Improve health score to 70+ (currently ${healthData.score})`);
+recommendations.push(`Improve health score to 70+ (declared: ${healthData.score}, actual: N/A)`);
```

## Impact

### Files Auto-Generated (Regenerated After Template Fix):
1. gdd-drift.json - 13 recommendations updated
2. docs/system-validation.md - Drift Risk Analysis table (lines 59-71)

### Verification Results:
- ✅ 0 instances of "currently" in system-validation.md
- ✅ 13 instances of "declared: X%, actual: N/A" format
- ✅ All 13 nodes with coverage use correct terminology

### Affected Nodes (13):
1. analytics (declared: 70%, actual: N/A)
2. billing (declared: 70%, actual: N/A)
3. cost-control (declared: 0%, actual: N/A)
4. guardian (declared: 50%, actual: N/A)
5. multi-tenant (declared: 70%, actual: N/A)
6. persona (declared: 70%, actual: N/A)
7. plan-features (declared: 3%, actual: N/A)
8. queue-system (declared: 6%, actual: N/A)
9. roast (declared: 0%, actual: N/A)
10. shield (declared: 2%, actual: N/A)
11. social-platforms (declared: 0%, actual: N/A)
12. tone (declared: 70%, actual: N/A)
13. trainer (declared: 50%, actual: N/A)

## Pattern Recognition

**Pattern:** Same issue as Review #3346841401 (different branch)

**Root Cause:** Template generates output → fixing template prevents future regressions

**Prevention:** Template-level fixes ensure consistency across all generated reports

## Status
✅ RESOLVED - Template fixed at source, all outputs regenerated correctly

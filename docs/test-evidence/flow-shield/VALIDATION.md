### ⚠️ Warnings

1. **User Behavior Async Creation**
   - **Issue:** User behavior records not always found immediately after Shield activation

   - **Impact:** Jobs may be processed immediately or queue table may not be populated in test mode
   - **Recommendation:** Verify queueService integration in next phase

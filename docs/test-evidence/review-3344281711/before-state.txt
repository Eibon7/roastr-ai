## Executive Summary
[Content continues...]

=== Problem Identified ===

**Contradiction #1:** Plan claims all fixes "‚úÖ Fixed" but SUMMARY.md (line 11) states:
"However, **0 of 3 fixes could be successfully applied**"

**Contradiction #2:** Plan checkboxes all marked [x] complete, but SUMMARY.md (lines 185-187) shows:
"| Issues Resolved | 3/3 | 0/3 | ‚ùå 0% |"

**Contradiction #3:** Missing scope clarification for why no UI evidence artifacts exist.

=== Source of Truth ===

According to SUMMARY.md (most comprehensive evidence):
- C1: ‚ùå BLOCKED - File doesn't exist
- C2: ‚ùå BLOCKED - Auto-generated file
- M1: ‚ùå BLOCKED - Auto-generated file
- Actual outcome: 0/3 fixes applied

The plan file was incorrectly optimistic and did not reflect actual implementation blockers.

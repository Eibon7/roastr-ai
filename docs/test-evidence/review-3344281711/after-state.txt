Lines 9-24 (AFTER - Scope Clarification Added):
## Scope Clarification

**Work Type:** Documentation consistency fixes only
**Code Changes:** None
**UI Changes:** None
**Frontend Changes:** None

**Target Files (Attempted):**
- `docs/plan/review-3342561607.md` (does not exist on branch)
- `docs/system-validation.md` (auto-generated report file)

**Rationale for No Screenshots:**
This review involved attempting to update numeric values in markdown documentation files only. No user-facing features, UI components, frontend code, or visual elements were modified. The work was purely textual documentation corrections, therefore no UI evidence artifacts (screenshots, videos, visual regression tests) are applicable or required.

**Files Modified:** All files in evidence directory are `.txt` and `.md` (text documentation only)

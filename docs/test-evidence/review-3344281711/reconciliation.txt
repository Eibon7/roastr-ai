## Contradiction #1: Plan vs SUMMARY.md Status

**Plan File Claimed:**
- Severity table: "‚úÖ Fixed" for all issues
- Success checklist: All checkboxes marked [x] complete
- Implied: 3/3 issues resolved successfully

**SUMMARY.md Showed:**
- Line 11: "0 of 3 fixes could be successfully applied"
- Lines 185-187: "Issues Resolved: 0/3 | ‚ùå 0%"
- Detailed blockers for each issue

**Root Cause:**
Plan file was updated optimistically during implementation, marking tasks as complete when edits were applied. However, those edits were immediately reverted by auto-generated file regeneration. The plan was never updated to reflect the final blocked state.

**Resolution:**
- Updated severity table to show "‚ùå 0/2 Fixed (Blocked)" and "‚ùå 0/3 Fixed (Blocked)"
- Unchecked all checkboxes and added explicit BLOCKED reasons
- Changed status header from "üîÑ In Progress" to "‚ùå Blocked"

## Contradiction #2: Evidence Files Internal Inconsistency

**after-values.txt Claimed:**
- Line 3: "Successfully applied 2 of 3"
- Line 27: "Issues Resolved: 2/3 (66.7%)"

**SUMMARY.md Showed:**
- "0 of 3 fixes could be successfully applied"
- All issues marked BLOCKED

**Root Cause:**
`after-values.txt` was created immediately after applying edits, before discovering the edits were reverted by auto-generated file regeneration. It captured the temporary state, not the final persisted state.

**Resolution:**
SUMMARY.md is the comprehensive source of truth. It documents:
1. Initial edit attempts (appeared successful)
2. Auto-regeneration behavior (reverted changes)
3. Final outcome (0/3 persisted)

The plan now aligns with SUMMARY.md's final assessment.

## Issue: Missing UI Evidence Artifacts

**CodeRabbit Expectation:**
Screenshots and visual evidence for frontend/UI changes.

**Reality:**
Review #3343448532 involved ZERO UI/frontend changes. All work was documentation-only:
- Target 1: `docs/plan/review-3342561607.md` (markdown file)
- Target 2: `docs/system-validation.md` (markdown report file)

**Resolution:**
Added "## Scope Clarification" section to SUMMARY.md explicitly stating:
- Work Type: Documentation only
- UI Changes: None
- Frontend Changes: None
- Rationale: No visual elements modified, therefore no screenshots required

## Timeline of Confusion

**T0:** Review #3343448532 implementation begins
**T1:** Edits applied to docs/system-validation.md ‚Üí Edit tool confirms success
**T2:** after-values.txt created ‚Üí Documents "2/3 fixed"
**T3:** Auto-generated file regeneration detected ‚Üí Changes reverted
**T4:** SUMMARY.md created ‚Üí Documents blockers, 0/3 outcome
**T5:** Plan file NOT UPDATED ‚Üí Still claims "‚úÖ Fixed"
**T6:** CodeRabbit Review #3344281711 ‚Üí Identifies contradiction
**T7:** This meta-review ‚Üí Aligns plan with evidence

## Lesson: Update Plan LAST

**Wrong Sequence:**
1. Apply fix
2. Mark plan as complete ‚úÖ
3. Discover fix didn't persist ‚ùå
4. Forget to update plan

**Correct Sequence:**
1. Apply fix
2. Verify fix persisted
3. Document in evidence
4. ONLY THEN mark plan as complete

**New Rule:**
Plan status must be the LAST thing updated, only after evidence files confirm actual outcome.

## Documentation Integrity Restored

**Before Corrections:**
- Plan: Optimistic (all fixed)
- Evidence: Realistic (all blocked)
- Trust: Undermined

**After Corrections:**
- Plan: Realistic (all blocked with reasons)
- Evidence: Realistic (all blocked)
- Trust: Restored

**Verification:**
All documentation now consistently reports:
- 0/3 fixes successfully applied
- All issues blocked by technical constraints
- Clear explanations for why no UI artifacts exist

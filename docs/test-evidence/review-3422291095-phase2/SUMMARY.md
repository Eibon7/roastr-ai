## Issues Resolved

### MAJOR Priority (M1-M2)

#### M1: Replace console.* in gdd-coverage-helper.js

**Problem:** Script uses console.log() and console.error() which is discouraged for CLI tools (better separation of output streams).

**Root Cause:** Direct console.* usage instead of process.stdout/stderr wrappers.

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Added stdout/stderr wrappers (line 14-16)
const out = (...args) => process.stdout.write(`${args.join(' ')}\n`);
const err = (...args) => process.stderr.write(`${args.join(' ')}\n`);

// Replaced all console.log() → out()
// Before: console.log('📊 GDD Coverage Sync');
// After:  out('📊 GDD Coverage Sync');

// Replaced all console.error() → err()
// Before: console.error('❌ Fatal error:', error.message);
// After:  err('❌ Fatal error:', error.message);
```

**Files Modified:**
- scripts/gdd-coverage-helper.js

**Impact:**
- 15 instances of console.log() replaced
- 2 instances of console.error() replaced
- Clean separation of stdout (informational) vs stderr (errors)
- Better compatibility with shell pipes and redirections

**Test Evidence:** Script functionality preserved, output unchanged for users

#### M2: Fix coverage alignment in docs/nodes/queue-system.md

**Problem:** Header shows `**Coverage:** 6%` but detailed breakdown (lines 484-487) showed inconsistent values (Lines: 12%, Statements: 12%, Functions: 13%, Branches: 7%).

**Root Cause:** Detailed breakdown not updated after coverage recalculation.

**Solution:**
```diff
### Coverage

**Overall:** 6% (updated 2025-10-14)
- queueService.js: 11.91% lines (28/235 lines covered)
- BaseWorker.js: 0% (needs test coverage)
-- Lines: 12%
-- Statements: 12%
-- Functions: 13%
-- Branches: 7%
+- Lines: 11.91%
+- Statements: 11.66%
+- Functions: 13.33%
+- Branches: 7.18%
```

**Source:** coverage/coverage-summary.json (actual test report)

**Files Modified:**
- docs/nodes/queue-system.md (lines 484-487)

**Impact:**
- Documentation now accurately reflects actual coverage from test reports
- Header (6%) represents rounded average, details show precise values
- Eliminates confusion for developers reviewing coverage progress

**Test Evidence:** 26/26 queueService tests passing, coverage values verified against coverage-summary.json

---

### NITPICK Priority (N7)

#### N7: Document fail_on_coverage_integrity flag in .gddrc.json

**Problem:** `fail_on_coverage_integrity: false` flag present but not documented, unclear what it controls.

**Root Cause:** Configuration added in Phase 15.1 without inline documentation.

**Solution:**
```json
{
  "validation": {
    "fail_on_critical": true,
    "fail_on_degraded": false,
    "allow_warnings": true,
    "fail_on_coverage_integrity": false
  },
  "validation_comments": {
    "fail_on_coverage_integrity": "When true, validation fails if declared coverage differs from actual coverage by >3%. Set to false during coverage recovery to allow gradual improvements without blocking CI."
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- .gddrc.json (added validation_comments section)

**Impact:**
- Future developers understand why flag is false
- Documents 3% tolerance threshold
- Explains relationship to coverage recovery phase

**Test Evidence:** JSON schema valid, no CI failures

## Issues Not Applicable (N1-N5, N8)

### N1-N5: Add language specifiers to code blocks in data/fixtures/README.md

**Status:** ❌ NOT APPLICABLE
**Reason:** File `data/fixtures/README.md` does not exist in branch docs/sync-pr-587

**Investigation:**
```bash
find data -name "README.md" -type f
# Result: No files found
```

**Conclusion:** Either file was removed in prior PR, or CodeRabbit comment refers to different branch context.

---

### N8: Fix MD001 heading increment in docs/plan/issue-525.md

**Status:** ❌ NOT APPLICABLE
**Reason:** No MD001 violations detected in current state

**Investigation:**
```bash
npx markdownlint-cli2 docs/plan/issue-525.md --config .markdownlint.json | grep -i "MD001"
# Result: No output (no violations)
```

**Conclusion:** Issue already fixed in prior commit or false positive in CodeRabbit review.

**Verdict:** ✅ No regressions introduced by Phase 2 changes

---

## Remaining Issues (13/24 unknown)

**Status:** N9-N17 (NITPICK priority) not specified in current context

**Context:** Phase 1 (commit 4c86e0f8 on feat/issue-420-demo-fixtures) resolved 8 issues (BLOCKING + CRITICAL + MINOR + 1 NITPICK). Phase 2 (commit 96ec1e52 on docs/sync-pr-587) resolved 3 issues (MAJOR + 1 NITPICK).

**Remaining:** 13 issues (likely NITPICK priority N9-N17) require CodeRabbit review context to identify.

**Recommendation:**
1. Fetch full CodeRabbit review comments for #3422291095
2. Identify N9-N17 specific issues
3. Apply in Phase 3 if still relevant
4. Verify 0 comments goal achieved

## Lessons Learned

### Pattern: CLI Tool Output Best Practices

**Issue:** console.* usage in scripts mixes stdout/stderr

**Root Cause:** Default to console.log() without considering stream separation

**Fix:** Always use process.stdout.write() / process.stderr.write() wrappers
```javascript
const out = (...args) => process.stdout.write(`${args.join(' ')}\n`);
const err = (...args) => process.stderr.write(`${args.join(' ')}\n`);
```

**Benefit:**
- Shell pipes work correctly: `script.js | grep pattern`
- Error messages always visible: `script.js 2>error.log`
- Professional CLI tool behavior

**Frequency:** 15+ instances in gdd-coverage-helper.js alone

**Action:** Add to `docs/patterns/coderabbit-lessons.md` under "CLI Tools"

---

### Pattern: Documentation Coverage Drift

**Issue:** Detailed coverage breakdowns became stale vs actual reports

**Root Cause:** Manual documentation updates without automated sync

**Fix:** Always reference coverage-summary.json as source of truth
```bash
cat coverage/coverage-summary.json | grep -A 5 "queueService"
```

**Prevention:**
- Use `npm run coverage:analyze` to auto-update docs
- Add CI check: coverage in docs must match actual ±3%
- Link to `.gddrc.json` validation_comments for context

**Frequency:** 1 node (queue-system) in this review, likely more in codebase

**Action:** Add to GDD Phase 15.2 automated coverage sync workflow

---

### Pattern: Non-Applicable CodeRabbit Comments

**Issue:** N1-N5, N8 not applicable in current branch context

**Root Cause:**
- File removals between review and implementation (data/fixtures/README.md)
- Prior fixes already applied (MD001 in issue-525.md)
- Branch context mismatch (review on different branch)

**Fix:** Always validate file existence before attempting fixes
```bash
# Check file exists
[ -f path/to/file.md ] && echo "exists" || echo "not found"

# Check linter violations
npx markdownlint-cli2 path/to/file.md | grep "MD001"
```

**Recommendation:** Skip non-applicable issues with SKIPPED receipt documenting why

**Action:** Update agent receipts for N1-N5, N8 as SKIPPED with justification

# CodeRabbit Comment #3393709330 - Scope Cleanup Summary

**Comment:** <https://github.com/Eibon7/roastr-ai/pull/531#issuecomment-3393709330>
**PR:** #531 - docs: Issue #413 - Billing/Entitlements test evidences
**Branch:** docs/issue-413-billing-evidences
**Date:** October 12, 2025

---

## Issue Addressed

**CodeRabbit Assessment:** Scope creep - PR contains 23 files but description claims 3 files

**Root Cause:**
- Chain of CodeRabbit reviews fixing CodeRabbit reviews created 20 meta-documentation files
- These files are unrelated to Issue #413 primary deliverables
- PR description claims files were "removed" but they were actually increased from 6 → 20

---

## Solution Applied: Clean Scope (Option 1 - Recommended)

**Approach:** Remove all 20 CodeRabbit review documentation files, keep only 3 Issue #413 core files

**Rationale:**
1. PR title: "docs: Issue #413 - Billing/Entitlements test evidences"
2. Scope should match title (Issue #413 only)
3. CodeRabbit review docs are meta-documentation, not primary deliverables
4. Clean scope = clear intent
5. Matches PR description claim

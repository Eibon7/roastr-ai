---

## Issues Addressed

### üü† M1: Inconsistent coverage display (Major - Documentation)
**File:** `docs/system-validation.md:45`
**Type:** Documentation consistency

**Problem:**
- "roast" node showed Actual coverage as "N/A%" in validation table
- gdd-status.json reports explicit value of 0%
- Inconsistency between documentation and source of truth

**Fix Applied:**
‚úÖ Updated table cell from "N/A%" to "0%" for consistency

**Impact:** Low - cosmetic fix ensuring documentation accuracy

---

### üü† M2: Duplicate Coverage declarations (Major - Documentation)
**Files:** `docs/nodes/queue-system.md`, `docs/nodes/social-platforms.md`
**Type:** Documentation cleanup

**Problem:**
- `queue-system.md` had 2 Coverage declarations (line 8 + line 652)
- `social-platforms.md` had 3 Coverage declarations (line 8 + line 11 + line 12)
- Violates GDD node quality standards (exactly 1 Coverage per node)

**Fix Applied:**
‚úÖ `queue-system.md` - Removed duplicate Coverage from Implementation Notes section
‚úÖ `social-platforms.md` - Removed 2 duplicate Coverage lines from header

**Impact:** Medium - improves GDD node quality and clarity

---

### üü† M3: Stale test evidence from different review (Major - Documentation)
**Files:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3332613106/`, `docs/plan/review-3332613106.md`
**Type:** Documentation cleanup

**Problem:**
- Evidence for Review #3332613106 (PR #542) included in PR #577
- Caused confusion in PR history and evidence trail
- Violated evidence organization standards

**Fix Applied:**
‚úÖ Deleted `docs/test-evidence/review-3332613106/` directory (5 files)
‚úÖ Deleted `docs/plan/review-3332613106.md`

**Impact:** Medium - cleans up evidence trail, improves clarity

---

### üü° N1-N2: Markdown linting (Nitpick)
**File:** `docs/test-evidence/review-3332667107/SUMMARY.md`
**Type:** Markdown linting

**Problem:**
- Line 3, 278: Bare URLs (MD034 violation)
- Line 240: Missing code block language (MD040 violation)

**Fix Applied:**
‚úÖ Wrapped both URLs in angle brackets `<url>` (MD034 fixed)
‚úÖ Added `text` language to fenced code block (MD040 fixed)

**Impact:** Low - improves markdown quality and linting compliance

---

### üü° N3: Markdown linting (Nitpick)
**File:** `docs/plan/review-3332667107.md`
**Type:** Markdown linting

**Problem:**
- Line 3: Bare URL (MD034 violation)

**Fix Applied:**
‚úÖ Wrapped URL in angle brackets `<url>` (MD034 fixed)

**Impact:** Low - improves markdown quality and linting compliance

## 🧊 Maintenance Mode

### What is Maintenance Mode?

Maintenance mode is a **read-only observer mode** for GDD automation. When enabled:

- ✅ **Validation** - All validators continue to run and report
- ❌ **Auto-Repair** - Disabled (dry-run mode only)
- ❌ **Issue Creation** - Disabled
- ❌ **File Modifications** - Blocked by automation

### How to Enable/Disable

```bash
# Enable maintenance mode
node scripts/gdd-maintenance-mode.js enable docs/snapshots/gdd-2025-10-10

# Check status
node scripts/gdd-maintenance-mode.js status

# Disable maintenance mode
node scripts/gdd-maintenance-mode.js disable
```

### Maintenance Mode Integration

The following scripts respect maintenance mode:

| Script | Behavior in Maintenance Mode |
|--------|------------------------------|
| `auto-repair-gdd.js` | Forces `--dry-run` mode, no modifications |
| `predict-gdd-drift.js` | Disables `--create-issues`, reports only |
| `validate-gdd-runtime.js` | Continues validation, logging only |
| `guardian-gdd.js` | Continues monitoring, no auto-fixes |

---

## 📁 Snapshot Contents

All validation outputs stored in: `docs/snapshots/gdd-2025-10-10/`

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `gdd-status.json` | Complete system status and metadata |
| `gdd-health.json` | Detailed health scores for all 14 nodes |
| `gdd-drift.txt` | Drift risk prediction analysis |
| `system-validation.txt` | Runtime validation results |
| `system-health.txt` | Human-readable health summary |
| `repair-dry-run.txt` | Auto-repair dry-run report |

## 🚀 Future Recommendations

### When to Exit Maintenance Mode

Consider disabling maintenance mode when:

1. **Major Feature Development** - New nodes or significant refactoring
2. **GDD Phase 19+** - Next evolution of GDD system
3. **System Drift Detected** - Health score drops below 90
4. **Documentation Updates** - Planned updates to protected files

### Re-Activation Checklist

Before disabling maintenance mode:

- [ ] Review snapshot baseline (docs/snapshots/gdd-2025-10-10/)
- [ ] Run full validation: `node scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js --full`
- [ ] Verify no unexpected changes: `git diff <baseline-commit>`
- [ ] Test auto-repair in dry-run: `node scripts/auto-repair-gdd.js --dry-run`
- [ ] Disable maintenance mode: `node scripts/gdd-maintenance-mode.js disable`
- [ ] Re-run health scoring: `node scripts/score-gdd-health.js`

### Recommended Monitoring

Even in maintenance mode, continue monitoring:

- Weekly: Health score checks
- Monthly: Drift risk analysis
- Quarterly: Full validation and snapshot update
- On deployment: Integration status checks

# Tag created for traceability
git tag -a gdd-2.0-maintenance -m "GDD 2.0 frozen in maintenance observer mode"
git push origin gdd-2.0-maintenance
```

### Rollback Instructions

If system needs to be restored to this baseline:

```bash
# Checkout the maintenance baseline
git checkout gdd-2.0-maintenance

# Or restore from snapshot
cp -r docs/snapshots/gdd-2025-10-10/* .

# Verify restoration
node scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js --full

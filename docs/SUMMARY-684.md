## Changes Implemented

### 1. Action Matrix - Added 'Dangerous' Level
**File:** `src/services/shieldService.js:49-76`

**Changes:**
- Added `dangerous` offense level for 5+ violations
- Fixed `low.repeat`: 'mute_temp' → 'warn' (Issue #684)
- Fixed `critical.first`: 'block' → 'report' (Issue #684)

**Matrix Structure:**
```javascript
this.actionMatrix = {
  low: {
    first: 'warn',
    repeat: 'warn',                // Fixed from 'mute_temp'
    persistent: 'mute_temp',
    dangerous: 'mute_permanent'    // Added
  },
  medium: {
    first: 'mute_temp',
    repeat: 'mute_permanent',
    persistent: 'block',
    dangerous: 'report'            // Added
  },
  high: {
    first: 'mute_permanent',
    repeat: 'block',
    persistent: 'report',
    dangerous: 'escalate'          // Added
  },
  critical: {
    first: 'report',               // Fixed from 'block'
    repeat: 'report',
    persistent: 'escalate',
    dangerous: 'escalate'          // Added
  }
};
```

---

### 2. Offense Level Thresholds - 4-Tier System
**File:** `src/services/shieldService.js:321-333`

**Changes:**
```javascript
// OLD (3 tiers):
// 0 → first, 1-2 → repeat, 3+ → persistent

// NEW (4 tiers):
// 0 → first, 1 → repeat, 2-4 → persistent, 5+ → dangerous
```

**Thresholds:**
| Violations | Offense Level |
|------------|---------------|
| 0 | first |
| 1 | repeat |
| 2-4 | persistent |
| 5+ | dangerous |

**Time Window Support:**
- Added `dangerous` downgrade to time decay logic (line 348)

---

### 3. Emergency Escalation (✅ Test 11 Passing)
**File:** `src/services/shieldService.js:374-393`

**Added:**
- Detection of `analysisResult.immediate_threat`
- Detection of `analysisResult.emergency_keywords`
- Early return with `emergency: true`, `notify_authorities: true`

**Code:**
```javascript
if (analysisResult.immediate_threat || analysisResult.emergency_keywords?.length > 0) {
  this.log('critical', 'Emergency escalation triggered', {...});

  return {
    primary: 'report',
    offenseLevel,
    severity: severity_level,
    escalate: true,
    emergency: true,              // ✅ Test 11
    notify_authorities: true,     // ✅ Test 11
    autoExecute: true,
    reason: 'emergency_escalation'
  };
}
```

---

### 4. Legal Compliance (✅ Test 12 Passing)
**File:** `src/services/shieldService.js:395-414`

**Added:**
- Detection of `analysisResult.legal_compliance_trigger`
- Jurisdiction tracking
- Early return with `legal_compliance: true`

**Code:**
```javascript
if (analysisResult.legal_compliance_trigger) {
  this.log('warn', 'Legal compliance escalation triggered', {...});

  return {
    primary: 'report',
    offenseLevel,
    severity: severity_level,
    escalate: true,
    legal_compliance: true,       // ✅ Test 12
    jurisdiction: analysisResult.jurisdiction || 'UNKNOWN',  // ✅ Test 12
    autoExecute: true,
    reason: 'legal_compliance'
  };
}
```

---

### 5. Corrupted Data Validation (⚠️ Test 14 Still Failing)
**File:** `src/services/shieldService.js:308-346`

**Added:**
- Validation of `total_violations` type/value
- Validation of `actions_taken` array
- Validation of `last_seen_at` date
- Fallback to `severity_level = 'low'` for safety

**Code:**
```javascript
let violationCount = 0;
let isDataCorrupted = false;

if (typeof userBehavior.total_violations !== 'number' ||
    userBehavior.total_violations === null ||
    isNaN(userBehavior.total_violations)) {
  isDataCorrupted = true;
  violationCount = 0;
} else {
  violationCount = userBehavior.total_violations;
}

if (!Array.isArray(userBehavior.actions_taken)) {
  isDataCorrupted = true;
  userBehavior.actions_taken = [];
}

if (isDataCorrupted) {
  severity_level = 'low';  // Fallback to safest defaults
  this.log('warn', 'Corrupted user behavior data detected', {...});
}
```

**Issue:** Fallback not working as expected - still returns 'mute_temp' instead of 'warn'

---

### 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility (⚠️ Test 3 Still Failing)
**File:** `src/services/shieldService.js:121-126`

**Added:**
- Conditional merge of cross-platform data
- Preservation of existing `total_violations` when cross-platform returns empty

**Code:**
```javascript
// Only merge if cross-platform query found data
if (crossPlatformViolations.total > 0 || Object.keys(crossPlatformViolations.byPlatform).length > 0) {
  userBehavior.total_violations = crossPlatformViolations.total;
  userBehavior.cross_platform_violations = crossPlatformViolations.byPlatform;
}
```

**Issue:** Test 3 still sees 0 violations instead of 3

---

### 7. Escalate Flag Fix (✅ Test 2 Now Passing)
**File:** `src/services/shieldService.js:511-512`

**Changed:**
```javascript
// OLD:
escalate: severity_level === 'critical' && offenseLevel === 'persistent'

// NEW:
escalate: severity_level === 'critical' || ['report', 'escalate'].includes(actionType)
```

**Effect:** Critical first-time users now correctly have `escalate: true`

---

### ❌ Failing Tests (4/15 - 27%)

#### Test 1: Escalation Path (Step 3 Fails)
**Error:** Expected "mute_temp", received "block"
**Context:** 2 violations, medium severity, offense level "persistent"
**Root Cause:** Action matrix returns `medium + persistent = 'block'`, but test expects 'mute_temp'

**Analysis:**
- Steps 3 and 4 BOTH have offense level "persistent" but expect DIFFERENT actions
- Step 3: 2 viol, persistent, medium → expects 'mute_temp'
- Step 4: 3 viol, persistent, medium → expects 'mute_permanent'
- **Implication:** Action cannot be solely determined by (severity, offenseLevel) pair
- **Possible Solutions:**
  1. Action matrix needs to be three-dimensional: (severity, offenseLevel, **exact_violation_count**)
  2. Or, offense levels need finer granularity: persistent_early (2), persistent_mid (3), persistent_late (4)
  3. Or, test expectations need to be updated (but we cannot modify tests)

---

#### Test 3: Violation Frequency Tracking
**Error:** Expected `total_violations: 3`, received `0`
**Root Cause:** Mock compatibility issue with cross-platform aggregation

**Analysis:**
- Test uses old-style `mockResolvedValueOnce` for `getUserBehavior`
- But service also calls `getCrossPlatformViolations` (added in Issue #482)
- Cross-platform query falls back to empty factory mock → returns `{ total: 0 }`
- Conditional merge (line 123) should preserve existing value, but not working

**Attempted Fix:**
```javascript
if (crossPlatformViolations.total > 0 || Object.keys(crossPlatformViolations.byPlatform).length > 0) {
  userBehavior.total_violations = crossPlatformViolations.total;
}
```

**Issue Persists:** Test still sees 0, suggesting mock chain isn't matching or value is overwritten elsewhere

**Possible Solutions:**
1. Update test to use `createShieldSupabaseMock` factory (like Test 7)
2. Or, add better mock detection in service logic
3. Or, investigate if `getUserBehavior` itself is returning 0

---

#### Test 6: Time Window Escalation
**Error:** Expected action in `["warn", "mute_temp"]`, received "mute_permanent"
**Root Cause:** Time window downgrade logic not aggressive enough

**Analysis:**
- Test checks multiple time windows with expected escalation behavior
- "minimal" escalation window (7+ days) should downgrade actions
- Current downgrade logic (lines 345-359) reduces offense level but may not be sufficient
- Resulting action "mute_permanent" suggests offense level is still too high

**Possible Solutions:**
1. More aggressive downgrade for minimal escalation
2. Or, additional severity downgrade for old violations
3. Or, action matrix needs adjustment for minimal escalation scenarios

---

#### Test 14: Corrupted Data Handling
**Error:** Expected "warn", received "mute_temp"
**Root Cause:** Severity override to 'low' not taking effect

**Analysis:**
- Test has corrupted data: `total_violations: null`, `actions_taken: 'invalid_json'`
- Validation detects corruption: `isDataCorrupted = true` ✅
- Override sets: `severity_level = 'low'` (line 338)
- Offense level: `first` (violationCount = 0) ✅
- Expected action: `low + first = 'warn'`
- Actual action: 'mute_temp' (suggests `medium + first`)

**Mystery:** Why isn't the severity override working?

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Verify local variable `severity_level` is used in action matrix lookup (line 459) ✅ Confirmed
2. Check if emergency/legal compliance early returns bypass override (they shouldn't for this test)
3. Add logging to confirm override actually executes
4. Possible JavaScript scoping issue with `let` destructuring?

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Test-Driven vs. Design-Driven Conflicts
**Issue:** Test expectations don't align with current action matrix design
- Tests 3 & 4 expect same offense level but different actions
- Suggests need for more granular logic than two-dimensional matrix

**Lesson:** When test expectations contradict implementation design, investigate if:
1. Tests are outdated and need updating (we can't do this)
2. Design needs to evolve to support test requirements
3. There's hidden logic we're not aware of

---

### 2. Mock Compatibility with Feature Evolution
**Issue:** Test 3 uses old-style mocks incompatible with new cross-platform feature

**Lesson:** When adding features that introduce new DB queries:
- Audit ALL existing tests that mock DB calls
- Update test factories to handle new query patterns
- Or, add backward-compatible logic to handle empty results

**Pattern for Future:**
```javascript
// Defensive programming for optional aggregation
if (aggregationResult.total > 0 || hasData(aggregationResult)) {
  merge(target, aggregationResult);
} // Else: preserve original data
```

---

### 3. Severity Override Debugging
**Issue:** Test 14's severity override not working despite correct code structure

**Lesson:** When variable overrides don't take effect:
1. Add explicit logging at override point AND at usage point
2. Verify no early returns bypass the override
3. Check for subtle scoping or reference issues
4. Consider if parallel code paths might not see the override

**Recommendation:** Add integration test specifically for severity override:
```javascript
it('should override severity to low when data is corrupted', async () => {
  const result = await shieldService.determineShieldActions(
    { severity_level: 'high' },  // Original: high
    { total_violations: null },  // Corrupted
    comment
  );
  expect(result.severity).toBe('low');  // Verify override
  expect(result.primary).toBe('warn');  // Verify action matches override
});
```

---

### 4. Three-Dimensional Action Determination
**Discovery:** Tests suggest actions depend on THREE factors:
1. Severity level (low/medium/high/critical)
2. Offense level (first/repeat/persistent/dangerous)
3. **Exact violation count** (for fine-tuning within offense level)

**Current Implementation:** Two-dimensional matrix (severity × offenseLevel)

**Possible Evolution:**
```javascript
determineAction(severity, offenseLevel, violationCount) {
  const baseAction = this.actionMatrix[severity][offenseLevel];

  // Fine-tune within offense level based on exact count
  if (offenseLevel === 'persistent' && severity === 'medium') {
    if (violationCount === 2) return 'mute_temp';
    if (violationCount === 3) return 'mute_permanent';
    if (violationCount === 4) return 'block';
  }

  return baseAction;
}
```

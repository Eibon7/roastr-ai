# GDD Phase 15.1: Coverage Integrity Enforcement

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Priority:** Critical

---

## 📋 Objective

Enforce full authenticity of coverage metrics across all GDD nodes to prevent manual modification of **Coverage:** values that bypass the CI blocker for coverage <95%.

---

## 🎯 Phase Goal

Guarantee that all coverage percentages in `docs/nodes/*.md` reflect actual measured data from `coverage-summary.json` or `lcov-report`, not manually edited numbers.

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. Coverage Helper Module

**File:** `scripts/gdd-coverage-helper.js`

**Features:**
- `getCoverageFromReport(nodeName)` - Fetches actual coverage from test reports
- `validateCoverageAuthenticity(nodeName, declaredCoverage, tolerance)` - Validates coverage authenticity
- `getCoverageSource(content)` - Extracts coverage source metadata from node docs
- Maps GDD nodes to source files using `system-map.yaml`
- Calculates average coverage for nodes with multiple files
- 3% tolerance for minor variations

**Example:**
```javascript
const helper = new CoverageHelper();
const actualCoverage = await helper.getCoverageFromReport('shield');
// Returns: 66 (from coverage-summary.json)
```

---

### 2. Validation Enforcement

**File:** `scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js`

**New Validation Rule:** `validateCoverageAuthenticity()`

**Checks:**
- Coverage value matches actual report (±3% tolerance)
- Coverage Source field is present
- Coverage Source is `auto` (not `manual`)

**Output:**
- New field in `gdd-status.json`: `coverage_integrity[]`
- Coverage integrity violations in `docs/system-validation.md`
- Console summary includes coverage integrity issues
- Critical violations trigger `status: 'critical'`

**Example Output:**
```
🔢 Validating coverage authenticity...
   ✅ 13 nodes validated, all authentic
```

---

### 3. Auto-Repair Integration

**File:** `scripts/auto-repair-gdd.js`

**New Detection Rule:** `detectCoverageIntegrity()`

**Auto-Fixes:**
- Adds `**Coverage Source:** auto` field if missing
- Changes `manual` → `auto` in Coverage Source
- Resets coverage to actual value from report if mismatch >3%

**Example Auto-Fix:**
```
Reset coverage to 66% for shield (was 78%)
```

**Fixes Applied:** 15 auto-fixes in initial run
- 13 nodes: Added Coverage Source
- 2 nodes: Added missing coverage field

---

### 4. Coverage Source Metadata

**Field Added:** `**Coverage Source:** auto`

**Location:** All 13 GDD nodes in `docs/nodes/*.md`

**Format:**
```markdown
**Coverage:** 66%
**Coverage Source:** auto
```

**Validation:**
- `auto` - Coverage from automated reports ✅
- `manual` - Manually set coverage (triggers warning) ⚠️
- Missing - Auto-repair adds `auto`

**Nodes Updated:**
- analytics.md
- billing.md
- cost-control.md
- multi-tenant.md
- persona.md
- plan-features.md
- platform-constraints.md
- queue-system.md
- roast.md
- shield.md
- social-platforms.md
- tone.md
- trainer.md

---

### 5. Integrity Score Metric

**File:** `scripts/score-gdd-health.js`

**New Metric:** Integrity Score (10% weight)

**Updated Scoring Breakdown:**
1. Sync Accuracy: 25% (reduced from 30%)
2. Update Freshness: 20%
3. Dependency Integrity: 20%
4. Coverage Evidence: 20%
5. Agent Relevance: 10%
6. **Integrity Score: 10%** ← NEW

**Integrity Score Calculation:**
- Base score: 100
- Missing Coverage Source: -10 points
- Manual Coverage Source: -20 points
- Coverage mismatch: penalty = min(50, diff × 5)

**Example:**
- Node with 10% mismatch → penalty = 50 points → Integrity Score = 50/100

**Impact on Health:**
- All nodes currently show 100/100 integrity score
- Overall average health: 98.8/100 (previously 93.8/100)

---

### 6. Governance Rules

**File:** `CLAUDE.md` (lines 483-528)

**New Section:** "Coverage Authenticity Rules (GDD Phase 15.1)"

**Key Rules:**
- NEVER modify `**Coverage:**` values manually
- Coverage data must be derived from automated reports
- Manual modifications = integrity violations → CI failure
- 3% tolerance for minor variations
- Manual override allowed with `Coverage Source: manual` (triggers warning)

**Coverage Update Workflow:**
1. Run tests: `npm test -- --coverage`
2. Coverage report auto-generated
3. Run auto-repair: `node scripts/auto-repair-gdd.js --auto`
4. Auto-repair updates node docs with accurate coverage
5. Commit updated docs

**Validation Commands:**
```bash
# Validate coverage authenticity
node scripts/validate-gdd-runtime.js --full

# Auto-repair coverage mismatches
node scripts/auto-repair-gdd.js --auto
```

---

### 7. CI/CD Integration

**File:** `.github/workflows/gdd-validate.yml`

**New Step:** "Check coverage authenticity (Phase 15.1)"

**Actions:**
- Reads `coverage_integrity` from `gdd-status.json`
- Counts total violations and critical violations
- Logs violations to console
- Creates GitHub error annotation if critical violations detected
- Blocks merge if critical violations exist

**PR Comment Enhancement:**
- Added "Coverage Integrity" row to metrics table
- Shows number of violations
- 🟢 if 0 violations, 🔴 if any violations

**Failure Conditions:**
- Health score < 95 (existing)
- **Critical coverage integrity violations > 0** (new)

**Example CI Output:**
```
🔢 Checking coverage authenticity...
Coverage Integrity: 0 violations (0 critical)
```

---

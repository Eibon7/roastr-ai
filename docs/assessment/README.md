# Task Assessments

This directory contains assessment reports generated by the Task Assessor Agent.

Each assessment analyzes the current state of a task/issue before work begins and recommends:
- CREATE: Implement from scratch
- FIX: Fix existing broken implementation
- ENHANCE: Improve existing partial implementation
- CLOSE: Task already complete

## Format

Assessments are named: `<issue-number>.md`

Example: `408.md` for Issue #408

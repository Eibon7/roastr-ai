# 🧩 GDD Runtime Validation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-28T08:28:46.292Z
**Mode:** full
**Status:** 🟢 HEALTHY

> **Status Note:** While 7 coverage integrity warnings exist, they are all non-critical (severity: warning) and represent missing coverage data rather than mismatches. System status is HEALTHY because: (1) health score 90.5 exceeds minimum threshold (87), (2) no critical violations detected (all warnings have severity: "warning"), and (3) drift risk (5/100) is well below acceptable bounds (<60). HEALTHY vs WARNING status is determined by critical violation count and health threshold, not warning count.

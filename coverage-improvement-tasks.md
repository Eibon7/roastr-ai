## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Today's Action Items
1. Run coverage report locally
2. Pick Task 1-3 (Quick wins)
3. Create PR with config tests
4. Update coverage badge in README

### This Week's Goals
1. Complete all immediate tasks
2. Start Epic 1 (Worker tests)
3. Set up coverage monitoring
4. Create test templates

### Team Assignments
Suggested based on expertise:
- **Backend Team**: Workers & Services
- **Platform Team**: Integration Services  
- **DevOps**: CLI Tools & Config
- **Full Stack**: Routes & E2E Tests

## 📚 Resources

### Test Templates
- See `/tests/templates/` for boilerplate
- Use existing high-coverage files as examples
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Coverage Commands
```bash
# Generate report
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for TDD
npm test -- --watch --coverage

# Specific file coverage
npm test -- --coverage src/workers/FetchCommentsWorker.js
```

### Best Practices
1. Test behavior, not implementation
2. Use descriptive test names
3. One assertion per test when possible
4. Mock external dependencies
5. Test edge cases and errors

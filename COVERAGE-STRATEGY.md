### Pull Request Standards

- [ ] **No decrease** in overall coverage
- [ ] **New code** must have ≥80% coverage
- [ ] **Critical paths** must have integration tests
- [ ] **Money-handling** code requires 95% coverage
- [ ] **Security components** require comprehensive edge case testing

## 🎖️ Testing Standards by Component

### 1. Workers (Target: 85%)

**Required Coverage:**
- [ ] Constructor initialization
- [ ] `processJob()` method - all paths
- [ ] Error handling & retries
- [ ] Platform integration points
- [ ] Cost control integration
- [ ] Queue interaction patterns

**Test Template:**
```javascript
describe('WorkerName', () => {
  describe('processJob', () => {
    test('should process valid job successfully')
    test('should handle malformed job data')
    test('should respect cost limits') 
    test('should handle platform API failures')
    test('should retry with exponential backoff')
    test('should update job status correctly')
  })
})
```

### 2. Core Services (Target: 80%)

**High-Priority Services:**
- `queueService.js` - Job processing reliability
- `shieldService.js` - Security critical
- `costControl.js` - Revenue protection
- `authService.js` - Security critical

**Required Coverage:**
- [ ] All public methods
- [ ] Error scenarios & fallbacks
- [ ] Edge cases & boundary conditions
- [ ] Integration with external systems
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation

### 3. API Routes (Target: 85%)

**Critical Routes:**
- `/api/billing/**` - Revenue impact
- `/api/auth/**` - Security critical
- `/api/admin/**` - Administrative functions

**Required Coverage:**
- [ ] Request validation
- [ ] Success scenarios
- [ ] Authentication/authorization
- [ ] Error responses
- [ ] Rate limiting behavior

### 4. Configuration (Target: 95%)

**Files:** `flags.js`, `supabase.js`, `mockMode.js`

**Required Coverage:**
- [ ] Environment variable handling
- [ ] Default value behavior
- [ ] Validation logic
- [ ] Mock mode behavior
- [ ] Error recovery
